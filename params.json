{"name":"AMICI","tagline":"A Matlab Interface to CVODES and IDAS","body":"AMICI is a MATLAB interface for the [SUNDIALS](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html) solvers [CVODES](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/description/description.html#descr_cvodes) (for ordinary differential equations) and [IDAS](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/description/description.html#descr_idas) (for algebraic differential equations). AMICI allows the user to specify differential equation models in terms of symbolic variables in MATLAB and automatically compiles such models as .mex simulation files. In contrast to the [SUNDIALSTB](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/description/description.html#descr_stb) interface, all necessary functions are transformed into native C code, which allows for a significantly faster compilation.\r\n\r\nThe interface was designed to provide routines for efficient gradient computation in parameter estimation of biochemical reaction models but is also applicable to a wider range of differential equation constrained optimization problems.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Generation of Model specific native C code\r\n- Forward Sensitivity Analysis\r\n- Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis\r\n- Steady State Sensitivity Analysis\r\n- Event Sensitivities\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nAMICI is a software package for MATLAB. It requires the Symbolic Math Toolbox and a configure C Compiler.\r\n \r\n## Support\r\n\r\nFabian Froehlich - fabian.froehlich@helmholtz-muenchen.de","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
