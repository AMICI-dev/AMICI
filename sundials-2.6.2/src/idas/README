IDAS is a package for the solution of differential-algebraic equation (DAE) 
systems with sensitivity analysis capabilities (both forward and adjoint modes). 
It is written in ANSI standard C.

IDAS can be used both on serial and parallel computers.  The main
difference is in the NVECTOR module of vector kernels.  The desired
version is obtained when compiling the example files by linking the
appropriate library of NVECTOR kernels.  In the parallel versions,
communication between processors is done with MPI, with OpenMP, 
or with Pthreads.

When used with the serial NVECTOR module, IDAS provides both direct 
(dense and band) linear solvers and preconditioned Krylov (iterative) 
linear solvers. Three different iterative solvers are available: scaled 
preconditioned GMRES (SPGMR), scaled preconditioned BiCGStab (SPBCG), and 
scaled preconditioned TFQMR (SPTFQMR). When IDAS is used with the parallel 
NVECTOR module, only the Krylov linear solvers are available.  For the 
latter case, in addition to the basic solver, the IDA package also contains 
a preconditioner module called IDABBDPRE, which provides a band-block-diagonal 
preconditioner.

IDAS is part of a software family called SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear and 
DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers [3].  This suite consists of CVODE, 
CVODES, ARkode, IDA, IDAS, and KINSOL.  The directory structure of the 
package supplied reflects this family relationship.

Several examples problem programs are included, covering both serial
and parallel cases, both small and large problem sizes, and both
linear and nonlinear problems.

The notes below provide the location of documentation, directions for the 
installation of the IDAS package, and relevant references. Following that 
is a brief history of revisions to the package.

E. Revision History
-------------------

---------------------------------------------
- Bug fixes
  - Made SuperLUMT call for backward problem consistent with CVODES.
  - Added ReInit and SetOrdering wrappers for backward problems.
  - Fixed for-loop bugs in IDAAckpntAllocVectors.

-New Features
  - Added missing backward problem support functions:
    IDALapackDenseB, IDALapackDenseFreeB, IDALapackBandB, IDALapackBandFreeB

v. 1.2.0 (Mar. 2015) ---> v. 1.2.1 (Mar. 2015)
---------------------------------------------
- Bug fixes
  - Fixed loop limit bug in SlsAddMat function.
  - In interfaces to KLU and SuperLUMT, added #include lines, 
    and removed redundant KLU structure allocations.
  - Minor documentation updates


v. 1.1.0 (Mar. 2012) ---> v. 1.2.0 (Mar. 2015)
---------------------------------------------
- New features
   - Two major additions were made to the linear system solvers that are
     availble for use with the IDAS solver.  In the serial case, an
     interface to the KLU sparse direct solver was added.
     For the parallel case, an interface to SuperLU_MT (the multi-threaded
     version of SuperLU) was added as a thread-parallel sparse direct solver option.
     As part of these additions, a sparse matrix (CSC format) structure 
     was added to IDAS.
   - Two new NVECTOR modules have been added for parallel computing
     environments --- one for openMP, denoted NVECTOR_OPENMP,
     and one for Pthreads, denoted NVECTOR_PTHREADS.
   - An option was added in the case of Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis with
     dense or banded Jacobian:  With a call to IDADlsSetDenseJacFnBS or
     IDADlsSetBandJacFnBS, the user can specify a user-supplied Jacobian
     function of type IDADls***JacFnBS, for the case where the backward
     problem depends on the forward sensitivities.
   - For the Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis case in which the backward problem
     depends on the forward sensitivities, options have been added to allow
     for user-supplied set, psolve, and jtimes functions.

- Bug fixes
   - In IDARootfind, a minor bug was corrected, where the input
     array rootdir was ignored, and a line was added to break out of
     root-search loop if the initial interval size is below the tolerance
     ttol.
   - In IDALapackBand, the line smu = MIN(N-1,mu+ml) was changed to
     smu = mu + ml to correct an illegal input error for DGBTRF/DGBTRS.
   - A minor bug was fixed regarding the testing of the input tstop on the
     first call to IDASolve..

- Changes to user interface
   - In the User Guide, a paragraph was added in Section 6.2.1 on
     IDAAdjReInit, and a paragraph was added in Section 6.2.9 on
     IDAGetAdjY.

- Other
   - In order to avoid possible name conflicts, the mathematical macro and
     function names MIN, MAX, SQR, RAbs, RSqrt, RExp, RPowerI, and RPowerR
     were changed to SUNMIN, SUNMAX, SUNSQR, SUNRabs, SUNRsqrt, SUNRexp,
     SRpowerI, and SUNRpowerR, respectively.  These names occur in both the
     solver and in various example programs.

v. 1.0.0 (May 2009) ---> v. 1.1.0 (Mar. 2012)
---------------------------------------------
- Bug fixes
   - errors in the logic for the integration of backward problems were
     identified and fixed.
   - a missing vector pointer setting was added in IDASensLineSrch.
   - in IDACompleteStep, conditionals around lines loading a new column of three
     auxiliary divided difference arrays, for a possible order increase, were fixed.
   - after the solver memory is created, it is set to zero before being filled.
   - in each linear solver interface function, the linear solver memory is
     freed on an error return, and the **Free function now includes a
     line setting to NULL the main memory pointer to the linear solver memory.
   - a memory leak was fixed in two of the IDASp***Free functions.
   - in rootfinding functions IDARcheck1/IDARcheck2, when an exact zero is found,
     the array glo at the left endpoint is adjusted instead of shifting tlo.

- Changes to user interface
   - One significant design change was made with this release: The problem
     size and its relatives, bandwidth parameters, related internal indices,
     pivot arrays, and the optional output lsflag, have all been
     changed from type int to type long int, except for the
     problem size and bandwidths in user calls to routines specifying
     BLAS/LAPACK routines for the dense/band linear solvers.  The function
     NewIntArray is replaced by a pair NewIntArray/NewLintArray,
     for int and long int arrays, respectively.
   - in a minor change to the user interface, the type of the index
     which in IDAS was changed from long int to int.
   - in the installation files, we modified the treatment of the macro
     SUNDIALS_USE_GENERIC_MATH, so that the parameter GENERIC_MATH_LIB
     is either defined (with no value) or not defined.
