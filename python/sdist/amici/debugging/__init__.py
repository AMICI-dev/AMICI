    Useful for analyzing simulation errors during preequilibration.
    Simulating the returned model will reproduce the behavior of
    simulation-based preequilibration.

    Note that for models with events, the simulation results may differ.
    During preequilibration, event-handling is disabled. However, when
    simulating the returned model, event-handling will be enabled.
    For events triggered at fixed timepoints, this can be avoided by setting
    :meth:`t0 <amici.Model.setT0>` to a timepoints after the last trigger
    timepoint.

        A copy of *model* with the same parameters, initial states, ...
