{\bfseries{Q}}\+: My model fails to build.

{\bfseries{A}}\+: Remove the corresponding model directory located in A\+M\+I\+C\+I/models/$\ast$yourmodelname$\ast$ and compile again.

{\bfseries{Q}}\+: It still does not compile.

{\bfseries{A}}\+: Remove the directory A\+M\+I\+C\+I/models/{\ttfamily mexext} and compile again.

{\bfseries{Q}}\+: It still does not compile.

{\bfseries{A}}\+: Make an \href{https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI/issues}{\texttt{ issue}} and we will have a look.

{\bfseries{Q}}\+: My Python-\/generated model does not compile from M\+A\+T\+L\+AB.

{\bfseries{A}}\+: Try building any of the available examples before. If this succeeds, retry building the original model. Some dependencies might not be built correctly when using only the {\ttfamily compile\+Mex\+File.\+m} script.

{\bfseries{Q}}\+: I get an out of memory error while compiling my model on a Windows machine.

{\bfseries{A}}\+: This may be due to an old compiler version. See \href{https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/issues/161}{\texttt{ issue \#161}} for instructions on how to install a new compiler.

{\bfseries{Q}}\+: How are events interpreted in a D\+AE context?

{\bfseries{A}}\+: Currently we only support impulse free events. Also sensitivities have never been tested. Proceed with care and create an \href{https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/issues}{\texttt{ issue}} if any problems arise!

{\bfseries{Q}}\+: The simulation/sensitivities I get are incorrect.

{\bfseries{A}}\+: There are some known issues, especially with adjoint sensitivities, events and D\+A\+Es. If your particular problem is not featured in the \href{https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/issues}{\texttt{ issues}} list, please add it!

{\bfseries{Q}}\+: I am trying to install the A\+M\+I\+CI Python package, but installation fails with something like \begin{DoxyVerb}amici/src/cblas.cpp:16:13: fatal error: cblas.h: No such file or directory
#include <cblas.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\bfseries{A}}\+: You will have to install a C\+B\+L\+A\+S-\/compatible B\+L\+AS library and/or set {\ttfamily B\+L\+A\+S\+\_\+\+C\+F\+L\+A\+GS} as described in the \mbox{\hyperlink{md__i_n_s_t_a_l_l}{installation guide}}.

{\bfseries{Q}}\+: Importing my model fails with something like {\ttfamily Import\+Error\+: \+\_\+some\+Model\+Name.\+cpython-\/37m-\/x86\+\_\+64-\/linux-\/gnu.\+so\+: undefined symbol\+: omp\+\_\+get\+\_\+thread\+\_\+num}.

{\bfseries{A}}\+: You probably installed the A\+M\+I\+CI package with Open\+MP support, but did not have the relevant compiler/linker flags set when importing/building the model. See \href{PYTHON.md\#model-compilation}{\texttt{ Python-\/\+A\+M\+I\+CI guide}}.
