A guide for reviewing code and having your code reviewed by others.\hypertarget{md_documentation_code_review_guide_autotoc_md107}{}\doxysubsection{Everyone}\label{md_documentation_code_review_guide_autotoc_md107}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t be too protective of your code
\item Accept that, to a large extent, coding decisions are a matter of personal preference
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t get personal
\item Ask for clarification
\item Avoid strong language
\item Try to understand your counterpart\textquotesingle{}s perspective
\item Clarify how strong you feel about each discussion point

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If there are no objective advantages, don\textquotesingle{}t force your style on others
\item Ask questions instead of making demands
\item Assume the author gave his best
\item Mind the scope (many things are nice to have, but might be out of scope of the current change -\/ open a new issue)
\item The goal is \char`\"{}good enough\char`\"{}, not \char`\"{}perfect\char`\"{}
\item Be constructive
\item You do not always have to request changes

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t take it personal -\/ the review is on the code, not on you
\item Code reviews take time, appreciate the reviewer\textquotesingle{}s comments
\item Assume the reviewer did his best (but might still be wrong)
\item Keep code changes small (e.\+g. separate wide reformatting from actual code changes to facility review)
\item If the reviewer does not understand your code, probably many others won\textquotesingle{}t either
