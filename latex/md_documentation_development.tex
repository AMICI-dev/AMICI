This document contains information for A\+M\+I\+CI developers, not too relevant to regular users.\hypertarget{md_documentation_development_autotoc_md80}{}\doxysubsection{Branches / releases}\label{md_documentation_development_autotoc_md80}
A\+M\+I\+CI roughly follows the \href{https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/}{\texttt{ Git\+Flow}}. All new contributions are merged into {\ttfamily develop}. These changes are regularly merged into {\ttfamily master} as new releases. For release versioning we are trying to follow \href{https://semver.org/}{\texttt{ semantic versioning}}. New releases are created on Github and are automatically deployed to \href{https://zenodo.org/record/3362453\#.XVwJ9vyxVMA}{\texttt{ Zenodo}} for archiving and to obtain a digital object identifier (D\+OI) to make them citable. Furthermore, our \mbox{\hyperlink{md_documentation__c_i}{CI pipeline}} will automatically create and deploy a new release on \href{https://pypi.org/project/amici/}{\texttt{ Py\+PI}}.

We try to keep a clean git history. Therefore, feature pull requests are squash-\/merged to {\ttfamily develop}. Merging of release branches to master is done via merge commits.\hypertarget{md_documentation_development_autotoc_md81}{}\doxysubsection{When starting to work on some issue}\label{md_documentation_development_autotoc_md81}
When starting to work on some Github issue, please assign yourself to let other developers know that you are working on it to avoid duplicate work. If the respective issue is not completely clear, it is generally a good idea to ask for clarification before starting to work on it.

If you want to work on something new, please create a Github issue first.\hypertarget{md_documentation_development_autotoc_md82}{}\doxysubsection{Code contributions}\label{md_documentation_development_autotoc_md82}
When making code contributions, please follow our style guide and the process described below\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Check if you agree to release your contribution under the conditions provided in {\ttfamily L\+I\+C\+E\+N\+SE}. By opening a pull requests you confirm us that you do agree.
\item Start a new branch from {\ttfamily develop} (on your fork, or at the main repository if you have access)
\item Implement your changes
\item Submit a pull request to the {\ttfamily develop} branch
\item Make sure your code is documented appropriately
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run {\ttfamily scripts/run-\/doxygen.\+sh} to check completeness of your documentation
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure your code is compatible with C++11, {\ttfamily gcc} and {\ttfamily clang} (our CI pipeline will do this for you)
\item When adding new functionality, please also provide test cases (see {\ttfamily tests/cpputest/} and \mbox{\hyperlink{md_documentation__c_i}{documentation/\+CI.md}})
\item Write meaningful commit messages
\item Run all tests to ensure nothing was broken (\mbox{\hyperlink{md_documentation__c_i}{more details}})
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run {\ttfamily scripts/build\+All.\+sh \&\& scripts/run-\/cpputest.\+sh}.
\item If you made changes to the Matlab or C++ code and have a Matlab license, please also run {\ttfamily tests/cpputest/wrap\+Test\+Models.\+m} and {\ttfamily tests/test\+Models.\+m}
\item If you made changes to the Python or C++ code, run {\ttfamily make python-\/tests} in {\ttfamily build}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item When all tests are passing and you think your code is ready to merge, request a code review (see also our \mbox{\hyperlink{md_documentation_code_review_guide}{code review guideline}})
\item Wait for feedback. If you do not receive feedback to your pull request within a week, please give us a friendly reminder.

\hypertarget{md_documentation_development_autotoc_md84}{}\doxyparagraph{General}\label{md_documentation_development_autotoc_md84}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All files and functions should come with file-\/level and function-\/level documentation.
\item All new functionality should be covered by unit or integration tests. Runtime of those tests should be kept as short as possible.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_documentation_development_autotoc_md85}{}\doxyparagraph{Python}\label{md_documentation_development_autotoc_md85}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We want to be compatible with Python 3.\+6
\item For the Python code we want to follow \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}{\texttt{ P\+E\+P8}}. Although this is not the case for all existing code, any new contributions should do so.
\item We use Python \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html}{\texttt{ type hints}} for all functions (but not for class attributes, since they are not supported by the current Python doxygen filter). In Python code type hints should be used instead of doxygen {\ttfamily $<$br$>$$<$b$>$Type$<$/b$>$\+:}. (All legacy {\ttfamily $<$br$>$$<$b$>$Type$<$/b$>$\+:} attributes are to be removed.)

For function docstrings, follow this format\+:
