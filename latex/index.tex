\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsubsection{About}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
A\+M\+I\+CI provides a multi-\/language (Python, C++, Matlab) interface for the \href{https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/}{\texttt{ S\+U\+N\+D\+I\+A\+LS}} solvers \href{https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/cvodes}{\texttt{ C\+V\+O\+D\+ES}} (for ordinary differential equations) and \href{https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/idas}{\texttt{ I\+D\+AS}} (for algebraic differential equations). A\+M\+I\+CI allows the user to read differential equation models specified as \href{http://sbml.org/}{\texttt{ S\+B\+ML}} or \href{http://pysb.org/}{\texttt{ Py\+SB}} and automatically compiles such models into {\ttfamily .mex} simulation files (Matlab), C++ executables or Python modules.

In contrast to the (no longer maintained) \href{https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software}{\texttt{ sundials\+TB}} Matlab interface, all necessary functions are transformed into native C++ code, which allows for a significantly faster simulation.

Beyond forward integration, the compiled simulation file also allows for forward sensitivity analysis, steady state sensitivity analysis and adjoint sensitivity analysis for likelihood-\/based output functions.

The interface was designed to provide routines for efficient gradient computation in parameter estimation of biochemical reaction models but it is also applicable to a wider range of differential equation constrained optimization problems.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsubsection{Current build status}\label{index_autotoc_md2}

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{Interfaces \& workflow}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
The A\+M\+I\+CI workflow starts with importing a model from either \href{http://sbml.org/}{\texttt{ S\+B\+ML}} (Matlab, Python) or a Matlab definition of the model (Matlab-\/only). From this input, all equations for model simulation are derived symbolically and C++ code is generated. This code is then compiled into a C++ library, a Python module, or a Matlab {\ttfamily .mex} file and is then used for model simulation.

 \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsubsection{Status of S\+B\+M\+L support in Python-\/\+A\+M\+I\+CI}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
Python-\/\+A\+M\+I\+CI currently passes 696 out of the 1780 ($\sim$39\%) test cases from the semantic \href{https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite/}{\texttt{ S\+B\+ML Test Suite}} (\href{https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI/actions}{\texttt{ current status}}).

In addition, we currently plan to add support for the following features (see corresponding issues for details and progress)\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Events (currently Matlab-\/only)
\item Algebraic rules
\item Models without species
\end{DoxyItemize}

contributions are welcome.

However, the following features are unlikely to be supported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+B\+ML extensions
\item {\ttfamily factorial()}, {\ttfamily ceil()}, {\ttfamily floor()}, due to incompatibility with symbolic sensitivity computations
\item initial assignments for parameters
\item {\ttfamily delay()} due to missing S\+U\+N\+D\+I\+A\+LS solver support
\end{DoxyItemize}

In addition to S\+B\+ML, we also plan to implement support for the \href{https://sed-ml.org/}{\texttt{ Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (S\+E\+D-\/\+ML)}}.
