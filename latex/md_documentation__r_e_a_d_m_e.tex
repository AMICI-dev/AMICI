This file describes how the A\+M\+I\+CI documentation is organized and compiled.

The A\+M\+I\+CI documentation is created using \href{http://www.doxygen.nl/}{\texttt{ doxygen}}. It combines Markdown files from the root directory, from {\ttfamily documentation/} and in-\/source documentation from the C++, Python and Matlab source files.

The documentation is generated by running \begin{DoxyVerb}scripts/run-doxygen.sh
\end{DoxyVerb}


The resulting H\+T\+ML and P\+DF documentation will be created in {\ttfamily doc/}. Upon merges to the {\ttfamily master} branch, the documentation will be deployed to github-\/pages at \href{http://icb-dcm.github.io/AMICI/}{\texttt{ http\+://icb-\/dcm.\+github.\+io/\+A\+M\+I\+C\+I/}}.

{\ttfamily scripts/run-\/doxygen.\+sh} also checks for any missing in-\/source documentation.\hypertarget{md_documentation__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md98}{}\doxysubsection{Doxygen configuration}\label{md_documentation__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md98}
The main doxygen configuration file is located in {\ttfamily matlab/mtoc/config/\+Doxyfile.\+template}. Edit this file for inclusion or exclusion of additional files.\hypertarget{md_documentation__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md99}{}\doxysubsection{Matlab documentation}\label{md_documentation__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md99}
Matlab documentation is processed by \href{https://www.morepas.org/software/mtocpp/docs/tools.html}{\texttt{ mtoc++}}. This is configured in {\ttfamily matlab/mtoc/config}.\hypertarget{md_documentation__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md100}{}\doxysubsection{Python documentation}\label{md_documentation__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md100}
Python documentation is processed by doxygen and doxypypy using the script and filters in {\ttfamily scripts/}.\hypertarget{md_documentation__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md101}{}\doxysubsection{Out-\/of-\/source documentation}\label{md_documentation__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md101}
Out-\/of-\/source documentation files should be written in Markdown and created within {\ttfamily documentation/}. Graphics for documentation are kept in {\ttfamily documentation/gfx/}.

Some guidelines\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Note that there are some incompatibilities of Github Markdown and Doxygen Markdown. Ideally documentation should be written in a format compatible with both. This affects for example images links which currently cause trouble in Doxygen.
\item Where possible, relative links are preferred over absolute links. However, they should work with both Github and Doxygen and ideally with local files for offline use.
\item Please stick to the limit of 80 characters per line for readability of raw Markdown files where possible.

However, note that some Markdown interpreters can handle line breaks within links and headings, whereas others cannot. Here, compatibility is preferred over linebreaks.
\item Avoid trailing whitespace

We want to maintain a list of publications / projects using A\+M\+I\+CI. This is located at {\ttfamily documentation/references.\+md}. This file is created by {\ttfamily documentation/recreate\+\_\+reference\+\_\+list.\+py} based on the bibtex file {\ttfamily documentation/amici\+\_\+refs.\+bib}.

After any changes to {\ttfamily documentation/amici\+\_\+refs.\+bib}, please run \begin{DoxyVerb}documentation/recreate_reference_list.py
