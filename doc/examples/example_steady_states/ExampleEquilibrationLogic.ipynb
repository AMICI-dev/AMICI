    "# Steady-state computation in AMICI\n",
    "\n",
    "*This notebook demonstrates how to compute steady states and their sensitivities using AMICI. We explore pre- and post-equilibration scenarios, sensitivity analysis methods, and techniques for handling singular Jacobians.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Steady states play a crucial role in the analysis of dynamical systems, and their computation is a fundamental task in many applications, such as biochemical networks, control systems, and ecological models. A steady state is a condition where the system's state variables remain constant over time, meaning that their time derivatives are - and remain - zero. In mathematical terms, for a system described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), a steady state $\\mathbf{x}^*$ satisfies the equation $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}^*, \\theta) = 0$, where $\\mathbf{f}$ is the right-hand side of the ODEs and $\\theta$ represents model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "AMICI offers several methods for computing steady states and sensitivities at steady state using both forward and adjoint sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steady-state sensitivities are also important in the context of model calibration if the training data contains steady-state measurements and gradient-based optimization methods are used for parameter estimation.\n",
    "Common experimental scenarios include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the system is assumed to start in a steady state, then it is perturbed and enters a dynamic state;\n",
    "2. the system is assumed to start in a dynamic state, and after some time it reaches a steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AMICI, these two cases are referred to as **pre-equilibration** and **post-equilibration**, respectively. The system can start in a steady state and reach a steady state again after a perturbation, therefore, the two cases are not mutually exclusive.\n",

For example, for the model above one can remove the second ODE and redefine `e` as `enzyme_total - c`, where `enzyme_total` is a constant specifying the total concentration of enzyme. In general, conserved quantities or conserved moieties are functions of the sates of the dynamical system that remain constant over time. They can be automatically removed in the SBML import of AMICI, if an environment variable ``AMICI_EXPERIMENTAL_SBML_NONCONST_CLS`` is set, using a heuristic-based conserved moieties identification approach presented in [De Martino et al.

    "#### Pre-equilibration with adjoint sensitivities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When using pre-equilibration, adjoint sensitivity analysis can be used for simulation. This is a particularly interesting case: Standard adjoint sensitivity analysis requires the initial state sensitivities `sx0` to work, at least if data is given for finite (i.e., not exclusively post-equilibration) timepoints:\n",
    "For each parameter, a contribution to the gradient is given by the scalar product of the corresponding state sensitivity vector at timepoint $t=0$, (column in `sx0`), with the adjoint state ($p(t=0)$). Hence, the matrix `sx0` is needed. This scalar product \"closes the loop\" from forward to adjoint simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, if adjoint sensitivity analysis is called with pre-equilibration, the initial state sensitivities are computed in just the same way as if this way done for forward sensitivity analysis. The only difference in the internal logic is that, if the steady state gets inferred via simulation, a separate solver object is used in order to ensure that the steady-state simulation does not interfere with the snapshotting of the forward trajectory from the actual time course.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, also an adjoint version of pre-equilibration is possible: In this case, the \"loop\" from forward to adjoint simulation needs no closure: The simulation time is extended by pre-equilibration: forward from $t = -\\infty$ to $t=0$, and after adjoint simulation also backward from $t=0$ to $t = -\\infty$. Similar to adjoint post-equilibration, the steady state of the adjoint state (at $t=-\\infty$) is $p=0$, hence the scalar product (at $t=-\\infty$) for the initial state sensitivities of pre-equilibration with the adjoint state vanishes. Instead, this gradient contribution is covered by additional quadratures $\\int_{-\\infty}^0 p(s) ds \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta}$. In order to compute these quadratures correctly, the adjoint state from the main adjoint simulation must be passed on to the initial adjoint state of backward pre-equilibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as the adjoint state must be passed on from backward computation to pre-equilibration, it is currently not allowed to alter (reinitialize) states of the model at $t=0$, unless these states are constant, as otherwise this alteration would lead to a discontinuity in the adjoints state as well and hence to an incorrect gradient."
