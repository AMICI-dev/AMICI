CVODE is a solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems (initial value problem) 
given in explicit form dy/dt = f(t,y). It is written in ANSI standard C.

CVODE can be used both on serial and parallel computers.  The main
difference is in the NVECTOR module of vector kernels.  The desired
version is obtained when compiling the example files by linking the
appropriate library of NVECTOR kernels.  In the parallel versions,
communication between processors is done with MPI, with OpenMP, or with Pthreads.

When used with the serial NVECTOR module, CVODE provides both direct (dense 
and band) and preconditioned Krylov (iterative) linear solvers. Three different
iterative solvers are available: scaled preconditioned GMRES (SPGMR), scaled 
preconditioned BiCGStab (SPBCG), and scaled preconditioned TFQMR (SPTFQMR). 
When CVODE is used with the parallel NVECTOR module, only the Krylov linear solvers 
are available. (An approximate diagonal Jacobian option is available with both 
versions.)  For the serial version, there is a banded preconditioner module 
called CVBANDPRE available for use with the Krylov solvers, while for the parallel 
version there is a preconditioner module called CVBBDPRE which provides a
band-block-diagonal preconditioner.

CVODE is part of a software family called SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear
and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers.  This suite consists of
CVODE, CVODES, ARKode, KINSOL, IDAS, and IDA, and variants of these.  
The directory structure of the package supplied reflects this family 
relationship.

For use with Fortran applications, a set of Fortran/C interface routines,
called FCVODE, is also supplied.  These are written in C, but assume that
the user calling program and all user-supplied routines are in Fortran.

The notes below provide the location of documentation, directions for the 
installation of the CVODE package, and relevant references. Following that 
is a brief history of revisions to the package.
