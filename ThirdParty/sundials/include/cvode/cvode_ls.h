  Type: CVLsJacFn
 
  A Jacobian approximation function Jac must be of type CVLsJacFn.
  Its parameters are:
 
  Jac is the SUNMatrix matrix that will be loaded by a CVLsJacFn 
  with an approximation to the Jacobian 
      matrix J = (df_i/dy_j) at the point (t,y). 
 
  t   is the current value of the independent variable.
 
  y   is the current value of the dependent variable vector,
      namely the predicted value of y(t).
 
  fy  is the vector f(t,y).
 
  user_data is a pointer to user data - the same as the user_data
      parameter passed to CVodeSetUserdata.
 
  tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3 are pointers to memory allocated for
  vectors of length N which can be used by a CVLsJacFn
  as temporary storage or work space.
 
  A CVLsJacFn should return 0 if successful, a positive 
  value if a recoverable error occurred, and a negative value if 
  an unrecoverable error occurred.
 
  NOTE: See the relevant SUNMatrix implementation header files and
      documentation for mechanisms to inquire about matrix 
      dimensions, and for efficient ways to set matrix entries.
                                                                 
  NOTE: If the user's Jacobian routine needs other quantities,   
      they are accessible as follows: hcur (the current stepsize)
      and ewt (the error weight vector) are accessible through   
      CVodeGetCurrentStep and CVodeGetErrWeights, respectively 
      (see cvode.h). The unit roundoff is available as 
      UNIT_ROUNDOFF defined in sundials_types.h.

  Type : CVLsPrecSetupFn

  The user-supplied preconditioner setup function PrecSetup and
  the user-supplied preconditioner solve function PrecSolve
  together must define left and right preconditoner matrices
  P1 and P2 (either of which may be trivial), such that the
  product P1*P2 is an approximation to the Newton matrix
  M = I - gamma*J.  Here J is the system Jacobian J = df/dy,
  and gamma is a scalar proportional to the integration step
  size h.  The solution of systems P z = r, with P = P1 or P2,
  is to be carried out by the PrecSolve function, and PrecSetup
  is to do any necessary setup operations.

  The user-supplied preconditioner setup function PrecSetup
  is to evaluate and preprocess any Jacobian-related data
  needed by the preconditioner solve function PrecSolve.
  This might include forming a crude approximate Jacobian,
  and performing an LU factorization on the resulting
  approximation to M.  This function will not be called in
  advance of every call to PrecSolve, but instead will be called
  only as often as necessary to achieve convergence within the
  Inexact Newton iteration.  If the PrecSolve function needs no
  preparation, the PrecSetup function can be NULL.

  For greater efficiency, the PrecSetup function may save
  Jacobian-related data and reuse it, rather than generating it
  from scratch.  In this case, it should use the input flag jok
  to decide whether to recompute the data, and set the output
  flag *jcurPtr accordingly.

  Each call to the PrecSetup function is preceded by a call to
  the RhsFn f with the same (t,y) arguments.  Thus the PrecSetup
  function can use any auxiliary data that is computed and
  saved by the f function and made accessible to PrecSetup.

  A function PrecSetup must have the prototype given below.
  Its parameters are as follows:

  t       is the current value of the independent variable.

  y       is the current value of the dependent variable vector,
           namely the predicted value of y(t).

  fy      is the vector f(t,y).

  jok     is an input flag indicating whether Jacobian-related
          data needs to be recomputed, as follows:
            jok == SUNFALSE means recompute Jacobian-related data
                   from scratch.
            jok == SUNTRUE  means that Jacobian data, if saved from
                   the previous PrecSetup call, can be reused
                   (with the current value of gamma).
          A Precset call with jok == SUNTRUE can only occur after
          a call with jok == SUNFALSE.

  jcurPtr is a pointer to an output integer flag which is
          to be set by PrecSetup as follows:
          Set *jcurPtr = SUNTRUE if Jacobian data was recomputed.
          Set *jcurPtr = SUNFALSE if Jacobian data was not recomputed,
                         but saved data was reused.

  gamma   is the scalar appearing in the Newton matrix.

  user_data  is a pointer to user data - the same as the user_data
          parameter passed to the CVodeSetUserData function.

  NOTE: If the user's preconditioner needs other quantities,
        they are accessible as follows: hcur (the current stepsize)
        and ewt (the error weight vector) are accessible through
        CVodeGetCurrentStep and CVodeGetErrWeights, respectively).
        The unit roundoff is available as UNIT_ROUNDOFF defined in
        sundials_types.h.

  Returned value:
  The value to be returned by the PrecSetup function is a flag
  indicating whether it was successful.  This value should be
    0   if successful,
    > 0 for a recoverable error (step will be retried),
    < 0 for an unrecoverable error (integration is halted).

  Type : CVLsPrecSolveFn

  The user-supplied preconditioner solve function PrecSolve
  is to solve a linear system P z = r in which the matrix P is
  one of the preconditioner matrices P1 or P2, depending on the
  type of preconditioning chosen.

  A function PrecSolve must have the prototype given below.
  Its parameters are as follows:

  t      is the current value of the independent variable.

  y      is the current value of the dependent variable vector.

  fy     is the vector f(t,y).

  r      is the right-hand side vector of the linear system.

  z      is the output vector computed by PrecSolve.

  gamma  is the scalar appearing in the Newton matrix.

  delta  is an input tolerance for use by PSolve if it uses
         an iterative method in its solution.  In that case,
         the residual vector Res = r - P z of the system
         should be made less than delta in weighted L2 norm,
         i.e., sqrt [ Sum (Res[i]*ewt[i])^2 ] < delta.
         Note: the error weight vector ewt can be obtained
         through a call to the routine CVodeGetErrWeights.

  lr     is an input flag indicating whether PrecSolve is to use
         the left preconditioner P1 or right preconditioner
         P2: lr = 1 means use P1, and lr = 2 means use P2.

  user_data  is a pointer to user data - the same as the user_data
          parameter passed to the CVodeSetUserData function.

  Returned value:
  The value to be returned by the PrecSolve function is a flag
  indicating whether it was successful.  This value should be
    0 if successful,
    positive for a recoverable error (step will be retried),
    negative for an unrecoverable error (integration is halted).

  CVodeSetMaxStepsBetweenJac specifies the maximum number of time
    steps to wait before recomputation of the Jacobian or

    the CVodeSetMaxStepsBetweenLSet, which merely indicates the 
    frequency with which the linear solver setup routine is called.

  CVodeSetEpsLin specifies the factor by which the tolerance on
    the nonlinear iteration is multiplied to get a tolerance on
