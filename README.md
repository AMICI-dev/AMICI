## Advanced Multilanguage Interface for CVODES and IDAS

## About 

AMICI provides a multi-language (Python, C++, Matlab) interface for the
[SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/) solvers
[CVODES](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/cvodes)
(for ordinary differential equations) and
[IDAS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/idas)
(for algebraic differential equations). AMICI allows the user to read
differential equation models specified as [SBML](http://sbml.org/)
or [PySB](http://pysb.org/)
and automatically compiles such models into Python modules, C++ libraries or
Matlab `.mex` simulation files.

In contrast to the (no longer maintained)
[sundialsTB](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software)
Matlab interface, all necessary functions are transformed into native
C++ code, which allows for a significantly faster simulation.

Beyond forward integration, the compiled simulation file also allows for
forward sensitivity analysis, steady state sensitivity analysis and
adjoint sensitivity analysis for likelihood-based output functions.

The interface was designed to provide routines for efficient gradient
computation in parameter estimation of biochemical reaction models but
it is also applicable to a wider range of differential equation
constrained optimization problems.

  (Matlab-only)

## Interfaces & workflow

The AMICI workflow starts with importing a model from either
[SBML](http://sbml.org/) (Matlab, Python), [PySB](http://pysb.org/) (Python),
or a Matlab definition of the model (Matlab-only). From this input,
all equations for model simulation
are derived symbolically and C++ code is generated. This code is then
compiled into a C++ library, a Python module, or a Matlab `.mex` file and
is then used for model simulation.
