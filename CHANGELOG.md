**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/compare/v0.29.0...v0.30.0


### v0.29.0 (2024-11-28)

**Fixes**

* Fixed race conditions in froot, which could have resulted in incorrect
  simulation results for models with events/heavisides/piecewise, for
  multi-threaded simulations.

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2587

* Fixed race conditions for the max-time check, which could have resulted in
  incorrect termination of simulations in case of multi-threaded simulations
  in combination with a time limit.

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2587

* Added missing fields in ExpData HDF5 I/O

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2593

* Added missing fields in ReturnData HDF5 output

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2602


* **Features**

* Generate models in a JAX-compatible format
  ([example](https://amici.readthedocs.io/en/develop/ExampleJaxPEtab.html))

  by @FFroehlich in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/1861

* Faster `fill_in_parameters_for_condition`

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2586

* Added Python function `writeSimulationExpData` for writing ExpData to HDF5

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2588

* Improved import of amici-generated models via `amici.import_model_module()`.

  So far, it was not possible to import different model modules with the same
  name. This is now possible if they are in different directories.
  Overwriting an already imported module is still not possible (and never
  was); any attempts to do so will raise a `RuntimeError`.
  While model packages can, in principle, be imported using regular
  `import`s, it is strongly recommended to use `amici.import_model_module()`.

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2604, https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2603, https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2596

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/compare/v0.28.0...v0.29.0


### v0.28.0 (2024-11-11)

**Breaking changes**

* Changed the default steady-state method to `integrationOnly`
  (by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2574)

  The default mode for computing steady states and sensitivities at steady
  state was changed to `integrationOnly`
  (from previously `integrateIfNewtonFails`).

  This was done for a more robust default behavior. For example, the evaluation
  in https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312148 shows that - at least for
  some models - Newton's method may easily lead to physically impossible
  solutions.

  To keep the previous behavior, use:
  ```python
  amici_model.setSteadyStateComputationMode(amici.SteadyStateComputationMode.integrateIfNewtonFails)
  amici_model.setSteadyStateSensitivityMode(amici.SteadyStateSensitivityMode.integrateIfNewtonFails)
  ```

**Fixes**

* PEtab import: **Fixed potentially incorrect sensitivities** with
  observable/state-dependent sigmas.
  This was fixed for all cases amici can handle, others cases will now result
  in `ValueError`s (https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2563).

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2562

* Fixed potentially incorrect disabling of Newton's method

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2576

* Fixed `ModelStateDerived` copy ctor, where previously dangling pointers
  could lead to crashes in some situations

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2583

* Added missing simulation status codes

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2560

* Check for unsupported observable IDs in sigma expressions

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2563


**Features**

* Optional warning in `fill_in_parameters`

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2578

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/compare/v0.27.0...v0.28.0

### v0.27.0 (2024-10-21)

This release comes with an **updated version of the SUNDIALS package (7.1.1)** (https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2513).
  For C++ users of some of AMICI's internal RAII classes, this may include some
  breaking changes. The Python API is not affected.

*Note regarding **editable** installations (`pip install -e ...`):*
Due to the SUNDIALS update, it will be necessary to clean out some temporary
build directories (at least `ThirdParty/sundials/build/`,
`python/sdist/build/`) before rebuilding the package.

**Fixes**

* Fixed a bug that led to program termination if a root-after-reinitialization
  error (potentially also others) occurred at an output timepoint

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2555

* Got rid of petab `DeprecationWarnings` when using the `amici_import_petab`
  CLI

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2517

* Now also sundials and suitesparse are built in debug mode when installing
  with `ENABLE_AMICI_DEBUGGING=TRUE`

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2515

### v0.26.0 (2024-07-02)

AMICI v0.26.0 requires sympy>=1.12.1 and petab>=0.4.0.

**Policy changes**

* Updated AMICI's [versioning / deprecation policy](https://amici.readthedocs.io/en/develop/versioning_policy.html)

  We will start removing deprecated features that had a deprecation warning
  for longer than six months in the next minor release.

**Deprecations**

* Passing individual tables to `amici_import_petab` is now deprecated.
  Use a `petab.Problem` instance instead.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/compare/v0.25.2...v0.26.0


### v0.25.2 (2024-06-16)

**Fixes**

* Fixed a bug in PEtab import which led to incorrect gradients

  **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  `amici.petab.sbml_import.{import_model_sbml,import_model}` no longer supports
  passing individual PEtab tables, but only the PEtab problem object.
  This functionality was deprecated since v0.12.0 (2022-08-26).
* Fixes for numpy 2.0 compatibility
  **NOTE**: As long as some amici dependencies don't support numpy 2.0 yet,
  you may need to pin numpy to <2.0 in your requirements
  (`pip install amici "numpy<2.0"`).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/compare/v0.25.1...v0.25.2

This release requires Python >= 3.10.

**Fixes**
* Fixed a bug in event handling that could lead to incorrect simulation
  results for models with events that assign to compartments *and* have
  additional event assignments
  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2428
* SBML import: handle `useValuesFromTriggerTime` attribute on events.
  This attribute was previously ignored. It is possible that now AMICI fails
  to import models that it previously imported successfully. For cases where
  `useValuesFromTriggerTime=True` made a difference, AMICI might have produced
  incorrect results before.
  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2429
* Faster code generation for models with events if they don't have
  state-dependent triggers
  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2417

  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2405
* Allow subselection of state variables for convergence check during
  steady-state simulations via `Model.set_steadystate_mask([1, 0, ..., 1])`
  (positive value: check; non-positive: don't check).
  by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/2387

### v0.15.0 (2023-01-11)

Features
* Improved logging by @dweindl in https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/pull/1907

  For Python: Don't print messages to stdout, but collect them in ReturnData
  and forward them to python logging, making it easier to filter specific
  messages or to disable output completely. Messages are also available via
  `ReturnData.messages`.

  **breaking change for C++ interface**:
  Messages aren't printed to stdout by default, but are collected in
  `ReturnData`. The user has to decide what to do with them.

**Full Changelog**:
https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/compare/v0.11.21...v0.11.22

### v0.11.21 (2021-11-21)

Fixes:
 * Fixed a bug in recursion depth computation for model expressions. This may
   have resulted in incorrect sensitivities for models with expressions nested
   more than 2 levels. (#1595)
 * Fixed improper handling of Piecewise functions in PySB import which may have
   produced incorrect simulation results. (#1594)
 * Fixed changed googletest reference which broke the CMake-based build if
   tests were enabled (#1592)

New:
 * It's now possible to build AMICI using Ninja (#1593)


### v0.11.20 (2021-11-12)

New:
 * Changed parameter mappings such that unassigned values have non-nan default values. This fixes erroneous evaluation of `llh` as `NaN` in some situations (#1574)
 * Added support for Python 3.10 (#1555)

Fixes:
 * Fixed a bug when simulation start time was not transferred when copying a solver instance (#1573)
 * Fixed a bug which led to incorrect sensitivies for models with multiple assignment rules or rate rules (#1584)

Other:
 * Update CI and documentation settings (#1569, #1527, #1572, #1575, #1579, #1580, #1589, #1581)

New:
* Added support for observable transformations (lin/log/log10) (#1567). Thereby supporting additional noise distributions in combination with least squares solvers.

Fixes:
* Fixed a bug when Newton sensitivity computation was activated despite specifying newton_steps == 0. The error occurs when simulation converges to a steadystate but simulation sensitivities are not converged according to convergence criteria. In that case simulation returned failure, but the newton rootfinding "finds" a steadystate even before the iteration check, leading to the erroneous computation of sensitivities via Newton/IFT. For singular jacobians this means the overall simulation still fails, but a different, more informative error message is displayed. (#1541)
* Fixed a bug where argument "outdir" in ODEExporter.__init__ would not be used (#1543)

Other:
* Improve checking support for SBML extensions (#1546)
