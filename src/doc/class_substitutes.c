 *
 * @class integer
 * @brief An integer value
 *
 * This class is an artificially created class in doxygen to allow more precise type declarations.
 * Matlab types associated with this class are all int-types (int8, uint8 etc).
 *
 * @class double
 * @brief A double value
 *
 * This class is an artificially created class in doxygen to allow more precise type declarations.
 * The MatLab type associated with this class is double.
