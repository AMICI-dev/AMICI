 @mainpage AMICI 0.1 General Documentation
 @section intro Introduction
 
 AMICI is a MATLAB interface for the <a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html" target="_blank">SUNDIALS</a> solvers CVODES (for ordinary differential equations) and IDAS (for algebraic differential equations). AMICI allows the user to specify differential equation models in terms of symbolic variables in MATLAB and automatically compiles such models as .mex simulation files. In contrast to the SUNDIALSTB interface, all necessary functions are transformed into native C code, which allows for a significantly faster numerical integration. Beyond forward integration, the compiled simulation file also allows for first and second order forward sensitivity analysis, steady state sensitivity analysis and adjoint sensitivity analysis for likelihood based output functions.
 
 The interface was designed to provide routines for efficient gradient computation in parameter estimation of biochemical reaction models but is also applicable to a wider range of differential equation constrained optimization problems.

 @section install Installation
 
 If AMICI was downloaded as a zip, it needs to be unpacked in a convenient directory. If AMICI was obtained via cloning of the git repository, no further unpacking is necessary.
 
 To use AMICI, start MATLAB and add the AMICI direcory to the MATLAB path. To add all toolbox directories to the MATLAB path, execute the matlab script
 @code installToolbox.m @endcode
 To store the installation for further MATLAB session, the path can be saved via
 @code savepath @endcode
 
 For the compilation of .mex files, MATLAB needs to be configured with a working C compiler. The C compiler needs to be installed and configured via:
 
 @code mex -setup c @endcode
 
 For a list of supported compilers we refer to the mathworks documentation: <a href="http://de.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2015b/index.html" target="_blank">mathworks.de</a>
 
 The tools SUNDIALS and SuiteSparse shipped with AMICI do <b>not</b> require further installation.
