	Abstract = {Motivation: Mathematical models have become standard tools for the investigation of cellular processes and the unraveling of signal processing mechanisms. The parameters of these models are usually derived from the available data using optimization and sampling methods. However, the efficiency of these methods is limited by the properties of the mathematical model, e.g. non-identifiabilities, and the resulting posterior distribution. In particular, multi-modal distributions with long valleys or pronounced tails are difficult to optimize and sample. Thus, the developement or improvement of optimization and sampling methods is subject to ongoing research.
Results: We suggest a region-based adaptive parallel tempering algorithm which adapts to the problem-specific posterior distributions, i.e. modes and valleys. The algorithm combines several established algorithms to overcome their individual shortcomings and to improve sampling efficiency. We assessed its properties for established benchmark problems and two ordinary differential equation models of biochemical reaction networks. The proposed algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art methods in terms of calculation efficiency and mixing. Since the algorithm does not rely on a specific problem structure, but adapts to the posterior distribution, it is suitable for a variety of model classes.
Availability and implementation: The code is available both as Supplementary Material and in a Git repository written in MATLAB.
Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract      = {Cellular development has traditionally been described as a series of transitions between discrete cell states, such as the sequence of double negative, double positive and single positive stages in T-cell development. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics suggest an alternative description of development, in which cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories. A cell{\textquoteright}s state along such a trajectory can be captured with pseudotemporal ordering, which however is not able to predict development of the system in real time. We present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that integrates time-series and genetic knock-out information with such transcriptome-based descriptions in order to describe and analyze the real-time evolution of the system. Pseudodynamics models the distribution of a cell population across a continuous cell state coordinate over time based on a stochastic differential equation along developmental trajectories and random switching between trajectories in branching regions. To illustrate feasibility, we use pseudodynamics to estimate cell-state-dependent growth and differentiation of thymic T-cell development. The model approximates a developmental potential function (Waddington{\textquoteright}s landscape) and suggests that thymic T-cell development is biphasic and not strictly deterministic before beta-selection. Pseudodynamics generalizes classical discrete population models to continuous states and thus opens possibilities such as probabilistic model selection to single cell genomics.},

	Abstract = {Single-cell time-lapse studies have advanced the quantitative understanding of cellular pathways and their inherent cell-to-cell variability. However, parameters retrieved from individual experiments are model dependent and their estimation is limited, if based on solely one kind of experiment. Hence, methods to integrate data collected under different conditions are expected to improve model validation and information content. Here we present a multi-experiment nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach for mechanistic pathway models, which allows the integration of multiple single-cell perturbation experiments. We apply this approach to the translation of green fluorescent protein after transfection using a massively parallel read-out of micropatterned single-cell arrays. We demonstrate that the integration of data from perturbation experiments allows the robust reconstruction of cell-to-cell variability, i.e., parameter densities, while each individual experiment provides insufficient information. Indeed, we show that the integration of the datasets on the population level also improves the estimates for individual cells by breaking symmetries, although each of them is only measured in one experiment. Moreover, we confirmed that the suggested approach is robust with respect to batch effects across experimental replicates and can provide mechanistic insights into the nature of batch effects. We anticipate that the proposed multi-experiment nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach will serve as a basis for the analysis of cellular heterogeneity in single-cell dynamics.},

@article{LoosKra2018,
	Abstract = {Mathematical models are nowadays important tools for analyzing dynamics of cellular processes. The unknown model parameters are usually estimated from experimental data. These data often only provide information about the relative changes between conditions, hence, the observables contain scaling parameters. The unknown scaling parameters and corresponding noise parameters have to be inferred along with the dynamic parameters. The nuisance parameters often increase the dimensionality of the estimation problem substantially and cause convergence problems. In this manuscript, we propose a hierarchical optimization approach for estimating the parameters for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models from relative data. Our approach restructures the optimization problem into an inner and outer subproblem. These subproblems possess lower dimensions than the original optimization problem, and the inner problem can be solved analytically. We evaluated accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency of the hierarchical approach by studying three signaling pathways. The proposed approach achieved better convergence than the standard approach and required a lower computation time. As the hierarchical optimization approach is widely applicable, it provides a powerful alternative to established approaches.},

  abstract     = {Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has recently been identified as the primary protein that detects cytosolic double stranded DNA to invoke a type I interferon response. The cGAS pathway is vital in the recognition of DNA encoded viruses as well as self-DNA leaked from the nucleus of damaged cells. Currently, the dynamics regulating the cGAS pathway are poorly understood; limiting our knowledge of how DNA-induced immune responses are regulated. Using systems biology approaches, we formulated a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of this pathway and examine the resulting system-level emergent properties. Unknown model parameters were fit to data compiled from literature using a Parallel Tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PT-MCMC) approach, resulting in an ensemble of parameterized models. A local sensitivity analysis demonstrated that parameter sensitivity trends across model ensembles were independent of the select parameterization. An in-silico knock-down of TREX1 found that the interferon response is highly robust, showing that complete inhibition is necessary to induce chemical conditions consistent with chronic inflammation. Lastly, we demonstrate that the model recapitulates interferon expression data resulting from small molecule inhibition of cGAS. Overall, the importance of this model is exhibited in its capacity to identify sensitive components of the cGAS pathway, generate testable hypotheses, and confirm experimental observations.},

  abstract        = {Dynamic modelling is a core element in the systems biology approach to understanding complex biosystems. Here, we consider the problem of parameter estimation in models of biological oscillators described by deterministic nonlinear differential equations. These problems can be extremely challenging due to several common pitfalls: (i) a lack of prior knowledge about parameters (i.e. massive search spaces), (ii) convergence to local optima (due to multimodality of the cost function), (iii) overfitting (fitting the noise instead of the signal) and (iv) a lack of identifiability. As a consequence, the use of standard estimation methods (such as gradient-based local ones) will often result in wrong solutions. Overfitting can be particularly problematic, since it produces very good calibrations, giving the impression of an excellent result. However, overfitted models exhibit poor predictive power. Here, we present a novel automated approach to overcome these pitfalls. Its workflow makes use of two sequential optimisation steps incorporating three key algorithms: (1) sampling strategies to systematically tighten the parameter bounds reducing the search space, (2) efficient global optimisation to avoid convergence to local solutions, (3) an advanced regularisation technique to fight overfitting. In addition, this workflow incorporates tests for structural and practical identifiability. We successfully evaluate this novel approach considering four difficult case studies regarding the calibration of well-known biological oscillators (Goodwin, FitzHugh-Nagumo, Repressilator and a metabolic oscillator). In contrast, we show how local gradient-based approaches, even if used in multi-start fashion, are unable to avoid the above-mentioned pitfalls. Our approach results in more efficient estimations (thanks to the bounding strategy) which are able to escape convergence to local optima (thanks to the global optimisation approach). Further, the use of regularisation allows us to avoid overfitting, resulting in more generalisable calibrated models (i.e. models with greater predictive power).},

However, some biological processes require the consideration of comprehensive reaction networks and therefore large-scale models. Parameter estimation for such models poses great challenges, in particular when the data are on a relative scale.Here, we propose a novel hierarchical approach combining (i) the efficient analytic evaluation of optimal scaling, offset, and error model parameters with (ii) the scalable evaluation of objective function gradients using adjoint sensitivity analysis. We evaluate the properties of the methods by parameterizing a pan-cancer ordinary differential equation model (\\&gt;1000 state variables, \\&gt;4000 parameters) using relative protein, phospho-protein and viability measurements. The hierarchical formulation improves optimizer performance considerably. Furthermore, we show that this approach allows estimating error model parameters with negligible computational overhead when no experimental estimates are available, providing an unbiased way to weight heterogeneous data. Overall, our hierarchical formulation is applicable to a wide range of models, and allows for the efficient parameterization of large-scale models based on heterogeneous relative measurements.Supplementary information are available at Bioinformatics online.

We take a quantitative computational modeling approach to describe propagation of histone H3K27 and H3K36 methylation states. We measure combinatorial H3K27 and H3K36 methylation patterns by quantitative mass spectrometry on subsequent generations of histones. Using model comparison, we reject active global demethylation and invoke the existence of domains defined by distinct methylation endpoints. We find that H3K27me3 on pre-existing histones stimulates the rate of de novo H3K27me3 establishment, supporting a read-write mechanism in timely chromatin restoration. Finally, we provide a detailed quantitative picture of the mutual antagonism between H3K27 and H3K36 methylation and propose that it stabilizes epigenetic states across cell division.},

These models usually comprise unknown parameters, which have to be inferred from experimental data. For quantitative experimental data, there are several methods and software tools available. However, for qualitative data the available approaches are limited and computationally demanding. Here, we consider the optimal scaling method which has been developed in statistics for categorical data and has been applied to dynamical systems. This approach turns qualitative variables into quantitative ones, accounting for constraints on their relation. We derive a reduced formulation for the optimization problem defining the optimal scaling. The reduced formulation possesses the same optimal points as the established formulation but requires less degrees of freedom. Parameter estimation for dynamical models of cellular pathways revealed that the reduced formulation improves the robustness and convergence of optimizers. This resulted in substantially reduced computation times. We implemented the proposed approach in the open-source Python Parameter EStimation TOolbox (pyPESTO) to facilitate reuse and extension.

  abstract = {In systems and computational biology, ordinary differential equations are used for the mechanistic modelling of biochemical networks. These models can easily have hundreds of states and parameters. Typically most parameters are unknown and estimated by fitting model output to observation. During parameter estimation the model needs to be solved repeatedly, sometimes millions of times. This can then be a computational bottleneck, and limits the employment of such models. In many situations the experimental data provides information about the steady state of the biochemical reaction network. In such cases one only needs to obtain the equilibrium state for a given set of model parameters. In this paper we exploit this fact and solve the steady state problem directly rather than integrating the ODE forward in time until steady state is reached. We use Newton’s method - like some previous studies - and develop several improvements to achieve robust convergence. To address the reliance of Newtons method on good initial guesses, we propose a continuation method. We show that the method works robustly in this setting and achieves a speed up of up to 100 compared to using ODE solves.},

This task can be computationally challenging due to the presence of local optima and ill-conditioning. While a variety of optimization methods have been suggested to surmount these issues, it is difficult to choose the best one for a given problem a priori. A systematic comparison of parameter estimation methods for problems with tens to hundreds of optimization variables is currently missing, and smaller studies provided contradictory findings.We use a collection of benchmarks to evaluate the performance of two families of optimization methods: (i) multi-starts of deterministic local searches and (ii) stochastic global optimization metaheuristics; the latter may be combined with deterministic local searches, leading to hybrid methods. A fair comparison is ensured through a collaborative evaluation and a consideration of multiple performance metrics. We discuss possible evaluation criteria to assess the trade-off between computational efficiency and robustness. Our results show that, thanks to recent advances in the calculation of parametric sensitivities, a multi-start of gradient-based local methods is often a successful strategy, but a better performance can be obtained with a hybrid metaheuristic. The best performer combines a global scatter search metaheuristic with an interior point local method, provided with gradients estimated with adjoint-based sensitivities. We provide an implementation of this method to render it available to the scientific community.The code to reproduce the results is provided as Supplementary Material and is available at Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1304034.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

  abstract  = {Summary
Targeted inhibition of oncogenic pathways can be highly effective in halting the rapid growth of tumors but often leads to the emergence of slowly dividing persister cells, which constitute a reservoir for the selection of drug-resistant clones. In BRAFV600E melanomas, RAF and MEK inhibitors efficiently block oncogenic signaling, but persister cells emerge. Here, we show that persister cells escape drug-induced cell-cycle arrest via brief, sporadic ERK pulses generated by transmembrane receptors and growth factors operating in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Quantitative proteomics and computational modeling show that ERK pulsing is enabled by rewiring of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling: from an oncogenic BRAFV600E monomer-driven configuration that is drug sensitive to a receptor-driven configuration that involves Ras-GTP and RAF dimers and is highly resistant to RAF and MEK inhibitors. Altogether, this work shows that pulsatile MAPK activation by factors in the microenvironment generates a persistent population of melanoma cells that rewires MAPK signaling to sustain non-genetic drug resistance.},

This connection is the basis for the interpretation of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Despite the central role of this coupling, we lack detailed knowledge about cell-specific contributions and our knowledge about NVC is mainly based on animal experiments performed during anesthesia. Anesthetics are known to affect neuronal excitability, but how this affects the vessel diameters is not known. Due to the high complexity of NVC data, mathematical modeling is needed for a meaningful analysis. However, neither the relevant neuronal subtypes nor the effects of anesthetics are covered by current models. Here, we present a mathematical model including GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal neurons, as well as the effect of an anesthetic agent. The model is consistent with data from optogenetic experiments from both awake and anesthetized animals, and it correctly predicts data from experiments with different pharmacological modulators. The analysis suggests that no downstream anesthetic effects are necessary if one of the GABAergic interneuron signaling pathways include a Michaelis-Menten expression. This is the first example of a quantitative model that includes both the cell-specific contributions and the effect of an anesthetic agent on the NVC.},

  year        = {2020},
  abstract    = {The brain is critically dependent on the continuous supply of oxygen and glucose, which is carried and delivered by blood. When a brain region is activated, metabolism of these substrates increases rapidly, but is quickly offset by a substantially higher increase in blood ﬂow to that region, resulting in a brief oversupply of these substrates. This phenomenon is referred to as functional hyperemia, and forms the foundation of functional neuroimaging techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which captures a Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal. fMRI exploits these BOLD signals to infer brain activity, an approach that has revolutionized the research of brain function over the last 30 years. Due to the indirect nature of this measure, a deeper understanding of the connection between brain activity and hemodynamic changes — a neurovascular coupling (NVC) — is essential in order to fully interpret such functional imaging data. NVC connects the synaptic activity of neurons with local changes in cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and cerebral metabolism of oxygen, through a complex signaling network, consisting of multiple different brain cells which release a myriad of distinct vasoactive messengers with specific vascular targets. To aid with this complexity, mathematical modeling can provide vital help using methods and tools from the field of Systems Biology. Previous models of the NVC exist, conventionally describing quasi-phenomenological steps translating neuronal activity into hemodynamic changes. However, no mechanistic mathematical model that describe the known intracellular mechanisms or hypotheses underlying the NVC, and which can account for a wide variety of NVC related measurements, currently exists. Therefore, in this thesis, we apply a Systems Biology approach to develop such intracellular mechanisms based models using in vivo experimental data consisting of different NVC related measures in rodents, primates, and humans. Paper I investigates two widely discussed hypotheses describing the NVC: the metabolic feedback hypothesis, and the vasoactive feed-forward hypothesis. We illustrate through multiple model rejections that only a model describing a combination of the two hypotheses can capture the qualitative features of the BOLD signal, as measured in humans. This combined model can describe data used for training, as well as predict independent validation data not previously seen by the model before. Paper II extends this model to describe the negative BOLD response, where the blood oxygenation drops below basal levels, which is commonly observed in clinical and cognitive studies. The model explains the negative BOLD response as the result of neuronal inhibition, describing and adequately predicting experimental data from two different experiments. In Paper III, we develop a first model including the cell-specific contributions of GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal neurons to functional hyperemia, using data of optogenetic and sensory stimuli in rodents for both awake and anesthesia conditions. The model captures the effect of the anesthetic as purely acting on the neuronal level if a Michaelis-Menten expression is included, and it also correctly predicts data from experiments with different pharmacological inhibitors. Finally, in Paper IV, we extend the model in Paper III to describe and predict a majority of the relevant hemodynamic NVC measures using data from rodents, primates, and humans. The model suggests an explanation for observed bi-modal behaviors, and can be used to generate new insights regarding the underpinnings of other complicated observed behaviors. This model constitutes the most complete mechanistic model of the NVC to date. This new model-based understanding opens the door for a more integrative approach to the analysis of neuroimaging data, with potential applications in both basic science and in the clinic.},

  abstract  = {Data integration to model-based description of biological systems incorporating gene dynamics improves the performance of microbial systems. Bioprocess performance, typically predicted using empirical Monod-type models, is essential for a sustainable bioeconomy. To replace empirical models, we updated a hybrid gene regulatory network-growth kinetic model, predicting aromatic pollutants degradation and biomass growth in Pseudomonas putida mt-2. We modeled a complex biological system including extensive information to understand the role of the regulatory elements in toluene biodegradation and biomass growth. The updated model exhibited extra complications such as the existence of oscillations and discontinuities. As parameter estimation of complex biological models remains a key challenge, we used the updated model to present a dual-parameter identification approach (the ‘dual approach’) combining two independent methodologies. Approach I handled the complexity by incorporation of demonstrated biological knowledge in the model-development process and combination of global sensitivity analysis and optimisation. Approach II complemented Approach I handling multimodality, ill-conditioning and overfitting through regularisation estimation, global optimisation, and identifiability analysis. To systematically quantify the biological system, we used a vast amount of high-quality time-course data. The dual approach resulted in an accurately calibrated kinetic model (NRMSE: 0.17055) efficiently handling the additional model complexity. We tested model validation using three independent experimental data sets, achieving greater predictive power (NRMSE: 0.18776) than the individual approaches (NRMSE I: 0.25322, II: 0.25227) and increasing model robustness. These results demonstrated data-driven predictive modeling potentially leading to bioprocess’ model-based control and optimisation.},

  abstract     = {Motivation Understanding how cell cycle responds and adapts dynamically to a broad range of stresses and changes in the cellular environment is crucial for the treatment of various pathologies, including cancer. However, measuring changes in cell cycle progression is experimentally challenging, and model inference computationally expensive.Results Here, we introduce a computational framework that allows the inference of changes in cell cycle progression from static single-cell measurements. We modeled population dynamics with partial differential equations (PDE), and derive parameter gradients to estimate time- and cell cycle position-dependent progression changes efficiently. Additionally, we show that computing parameter sensitivities for the optimization problem by solving a system of PDEs is computationally feasible and allows efficient and exact estimation of parameters. We showcase our framework by estimating the changes in cell cycle progression in K562 cells treated with Nocodazole and identify an arrest in M-phase transition that matches the expected behavior of microtubule polymerization inhibition.Conclusions Our results have two major implications: First, this framework can be scaled to high-throughput compound screens, providing a fast, stable, and efficient protocol to generate new insights into changes in cell cycle progression. Second, knowledge of the cell cycle stage- and time-dependent progression function allows transformation from pseudotime to real-time thereby enabling real-time analysis of molecular rates in response to treatments.Availability MAPiT toolbox (Karsten Kuritz 2020) is available at github: https://github.com/karstenkuritz/MAPiT.},

  abstract  = {Intheﬁeldofpharmacologics,physiologically-basedpharmacokinetic(PBPK)models can be used for predicting the pharmacokinetics of a drug compound in the body. These models are often a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) that describe the transport of a drug between diﬀerent compartments of the body. The models depend on several parameters, some of which cannot be measured experimentally and instead these parameters are often estimated from experimental data using maximum likelihood. However, in many applications in systems biology, estimates will suﬀer from unidentiﬁability issues, meaning that well-determined estimates cannot be inferred from the data [17]. Thisproblemcomesintwoforms,structuralunidentiﬁabilityandpracticalunidentiﬁability,bothofwhichcanbeanalyzedwiththeproﬁlelikelihoodmethoddeveloped by Raue et.al [14]. The proﬁle likelihood method is a numerical method for calculating likelihood-based conﬁdence intervals of the parameters, which are then used to assess identiﬁability. In this project the proﬁle likelihood method is implemented in MATLAB and used to perform identiﬁability analysis on key model parameters for three PBPK models using simulated data. Thus, the results of this project are both a showcase of the proﬁlelikelihoodmethodandananalysisoftheidentiﬁabilityofparametersinsome speciﬁc models used for pulmonary drug delivery. The results indicate that if very precise measurements could be taken then all parameters considered would be identiﬁable. When a reasonable measurement error is applied on the simulated data the same is not true. Some parameters, such as the in-vivo pulmonary permeability and deposition fraction will remain identiﬁable, but most other parameters will suﬀer from practical unidentiﬁability. With a reasonable measurement error the identiﬁability of most model parameters will also be dependent on the particular error realization. To address these issues, additional dataisconsideredbyobservinghowtheuncertaintyinparameterestimatesimpacts observables.

  abstract     = {The current era of big biomedical data accumulation and availability brings data integration opportunities for leveraging its totality to make new discoveries and/or clinically predictive models. Black-box statistical and machine learning methods are powerful for such integration, but often cannot provide mechanistic reasoning, particularly on the single-cell level. While single-cell mechanistic models clearly enable such reasoning, they are predominantly {\textquotedblleft}small-scale{\textquotedblright}, and struggle with the scalability and reusability required for meaningful data integration. Here, we present an open-source pipeline for scalable, single-cell mechanistic modeling from simple, annotated input files that can serve as a foundation for mechanistic data integration. As a test case, we convert one of the largest existing single-cell mechanistic models to this format, demonstrating robustness and reproducibility of the approach. We show that the model cell line context can be changed with simple replacement of input file parameter values. We next use this new model to test alternative mechanistic hypotheses for the experimental observations that interferon-gamma (IFNG) inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell proliferation. Model- based analysis suggested, and experiments support that these observations are better explained by IFNG-induced SOCS1 expression sequestering activated EGF receptors, thereby downregulating AKT activity, as opposed to direct IFNG-induced upregulation of p21 expression. Overall, this new pipeline enables large-scale, single-cell, and mechanistically-transparent modeling as a data integration modality complementary to machine learning.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In this manuscript, we investigate which choices of algorithms and hyperparameters are generally favorable when dealing with ODE models arising from biological processes. To ensure a representative evaluation, we considered 142 published models. Our study provides evidence that most ODEs in computational biology are stiff, and we give guidelines for the choice of algorithms and hyperparameters.

Classically, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation is assumed to occur via progenitor compartments of decreasing plasticity and increasing maturity in a specific, hierarchical manner. The classical hierarchy has been challenged in the past by alternative differentiation pathways. We abstracted experimental evidence into 10 differentiation hierarchies, each comprising 7 cell type compartments. By fitting ordinary differential equation models with realistic waiting time distributions to time-resolved data of differentiating HSCs from 10 healthy human donors, we identified plausible lineage hierarchies and rejected others. We found that, for most donors, the classical model of hematopoiesis is preferred. Surprisingly, multipotent lymphoid progenitor differentiation into granulocyte-monocyte progenitors is plausible in 90% of samples. An in silico analysis confirmed that, even for strong noise, the classical model can be identified robustly. Our computational approach infers differentiation hierarchies in a personalized fashion and can be used to gain insights into kinetic alterations of diseased hematopoiesis.},

Background
Over 1 year since the first reported case, the true COVID-19 burden in Ethiopia remains unknown due to insufficient surveillance. We aimed to investigate the seroepidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 among front-line hospital workers and communities in Ethiopia.
Methods
We did a population-based, longitudinal cohort study at two tertiary teaching hospitals involving hospital workers, rural residents, and urban communities in Jimma and Addis Ababa. Hospital workers were recruited at both hospitals, and community participants were recruited by convenience sampling including urban metropolitan settings, urban and semi-urban settings, and rural communities. Participants were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had provided written informed consent, and were willing to provide blood samples by venepuncture. Only one participant per household was recruited. Serology was done with Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid assay in three consecutive rounds, with a mean interval of 6 weeks between tests, to obtain seroprevalence and incidence estimates within the cohorts.
Findings
Between Aug 5, 2020, and April 10, 2021, we did three survey rounds with a total of 1104 hospital workers and 1229 community residents participating. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among hospital workers increased strongly during the study period: in Addis Ababa, it increased from 10·9% (95% credible interval [CrI] 8·3–13·8) in August, 2020, to 53·7% (44·8–62·5) in February, 2021, with an incidence rate of 2223 per 100 000 person-weeks (95% CI 1785–2696); in Jimma Town, it increased from 30·8% (95% CrI 26·9–34·8) in November, 2020, to 56·1% (51·1–61·1) in February, 2021, with an incidence rate of 3810 per 100 000 person-weeks (95% CI 3149–4540). Among urban communities, an almost 40% increase in seroprevalence was observed in early 2021, with incidence rates of 1622 per 100 000 person-weeks (1004–2429) in Jimma Town and 4646 per 100 000 person-weeks (2797–7255) in Addis Ababa. Seroprevalence in rural communities increased from 18·0% (95% CrI 13·5–23·2) in November, 2020, to 31·0% (22·3–40·3) in March, 2021.
Interpretation
SARS-CoV-2 spread in Ethiopia has been highly dynamic among hospital worker and urban communities. We can speculate that the greatest wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections is currently evolving in rural Ethiopia, and thus requires focused attention regarding health-care burden and disease prevention.

As model sizes and datasets are steadily growing, established parameter optimization approaches for mechanistic models become computationally extremely challenging. Mini-batch optimization methods, as employed in deep learning, have better scaling properties. In this work, we adapt, apply, and benchmark mini-batch optimization for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, thereby establishing a direct link between dynamic modelling and machine learning. On our main application example, a large-scale model of cancer signaling, we benchmark mini-batch optimization against established methods, achieving better optimization results and reducing computation by more than an order of magnitude. We expect that our work will serve as a first step towards mini-batch optimization tailored to ODE models and enable modelling of even larger and more complex systems than what is currently possible.},

  abstract  = {The design of efficient combination therapies is a difficult key challenge in the treatment of complex diseases such as cancers. The large heterogeneity of cancers and the large number of available drugs renders exhaustive in vivo or even in vitro investigation of possible treatments impractical. In recent years, sophisticated mechanistic, ordinary differential equation-based pathways models that can predict treatment responses at a molecular level have been developed. However, surprisingly little effort has been put into leveraging these models to find novel therapies. In this paper we use for the first time, to our knowledge, a large-scale state-of-the-art pan-cancer signaling pathway model to identify candidates for novel combination therapies to treat individual cancer cell lines from various tissues (e.g., minimizing proliferation while keeping dosage low to avoid adverse side effects) and populations of heterogeneous cancer cell lines (e.g., minimizing the maximum or average proliferation across the cell lines while keeping dosage low). We also show how our method can be used to optimize the drug combinations used in sequential treatment plans—that is, optimized sequences of potentially different drug combinations—providing additional benefits. In order to solve the treatment optimization problems, we combine the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm with a significantly more scalable sampling scheme for truncated Gaussian distributions, based on a Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo method. These optimization techniques are independent of the signaling pathway model, and can thus be adapted to find treatment candidates for other complex diseases than cancers as well, as long as a suitable predictive model is available.},

We tackled this problem by manipulating the cell cycle during early Xenopus laevis embryogenesis and analyzing in vivo histone H4K20 methylation kinetics. The global distribution of un-, mono-, di-, and tri-methylated histone H4K20 was measured by mass spectrometry in normal and cell-cycle-arrested embryos over time. Using multi-start maximum likelihood optimization and quantitative model selection, we found that three specific biological methylation rate constants were required to explain the measured H4K20 methylation state kinetics. While demethylation is essential for regulating H4K20 methylation kinetics in non-cycling cells, demethylation is very likely dispensable in rapidly dividing cells of early embryos, suggesting that cell-cycle-mediated dilution of H4K20 methylation is an essential regulatory component for shaping its epigenetic landscape during early development.A record of this paper?s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.},

  abstract = {{Ordinary differential equation models are nowadays widely used for the mechanistic description of biological processes and their temporal evolution. These models typically have many unknown and nonmeasurable parameters, which have to be determined by fitting the model to experimental data. In order to perform this task, known as parameter estimation or model calibration, the modeller faces challenges such as poor parameter identifiability, lack of sufficiently informative experimental data and the existence of local minima in the objective function landscape. These issues tend to worsen with larger model sizes, increasing the computational complexity and the number of unknown parameters. An incorrectly calibrated model is problematic because it may result in inaccurate predictions and misleading conclusions. For nonexpert users, there are a large number of potential pitfalls. Here, we provide a protocol that guides the user through all the steps involved in the calibration of dynamic models. We illustrate the methodology with two models and provide all the code required to reproduce the results and perform the same analysis on new models. Our protocol provides practitioners and researchers in biological modelling with a one-stop guide that is at the same time compact and sufficiently comprehensive to cover all aspects of the problem.}},

However, the introduced approximation error is often not clear. It has been shown that ABC actually gives exact inference under the implicit assumption of a measurement noise model. Noise being common in biological systems, it is intriguing to exploit this insight. But this is difficult in practice, as ABC is in general highly computationally demanding. Thus, the question we want to answer here is how to efficiently account for measurement noise in ABC.We illustrate exemplarily how ABC yields erroneous parameter estimates when neglecting measurement noise. Then, we discuss practical ways of correctly including the measurement noise in the analysis. We present an efficient adaptive sequential importance sampling-based algorithm applicable to various model types and noise models. We test and compare it on several models, including ordinary and stochastic differential equations, Markov jump processes and stochastically interacting agents, and noise models including normal, Laplace and Poisson noise. We conclude that the proposed algorithm could improve the accuracy of parameter estimates for a broad spectrum of applications.The developed algorithms are made publicly available as part of the open-source python toolbox pyABC (https://github.com/icb-dcm/pyabc).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

Survival or apoptosis is a binary decision in individual cells. However, at the cell-population level, a graded increase in survival of colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cells is observed upon stimulation with erythropoietin (Epo). To identify components of Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (JAK2/STAT5) signal transduction that contribute to the graded population response, we extended a cell-population-level model calibrated with experimental data to study the behavior in single cells. The single-cell model shows that the high cell-to-cell variability in nuclear phosphorylated STAT5 is caused by variability in the amount of Epo receptor (EpoR):JAK2 complexes and of SHP1, as well as the extent of nuclear import because of the large variance in the cytoplasmic volume of CFU-E cells. 24–118 pSTAT5 molecules in the nucleus for 120 min are sufficient to ensure cell survival. Thus, variability in membrane-associated processes is sufficient to convert a switch-like behavior at the single-cell level to a graded population-level response.},

The model was trained on lipidomic data of a reference S. cerevisiae strain, single knockout mutants, and lipid overproduction strains reported in literature. The model was used to design mutants for fatty alcohol overproduction and the lipidomic analysis of the resultant mutant strains coupled with model-guided hypothesis led to discovery of a futile cycle in the triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathway. In addition, the model was used to explain successful and unsuccessful mutant designs in metabolic engineering literature. Thus, this kinetic model of lipid metabolism can not only enable the discovery of new phenomenon in lipid metabolism but also the engineering of mutant strains for overproduction of lipids.},

  abstract = {{Dynamic mechanistic modelling in systems biology has been hampered by the complexity and variability associated with the underlying interactions, and by uncertain and sparse experimental measurements. Ensemble modelling, a concept initially developed in statistical mechanics, has been introduced in biological applications with the aim of mitigating those issues. Ensemble modelling uses a collection of different models compatible with the observed data to describe the phenomena of interest. However, since systems biology models often suffer from lack of identifiability and observability, ensembles of models are particularly unreliable when predicting non-observable states.We present a strategy to assess and improve the reliability of a class of model ensembles. In particular, we consider kinetic models described using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a fixed structure. Our approach builds an ensemble with a selection of the parameter vectors found when performing parameter estimation with a global optimization metaheuristic. This technique enforces diversity during the sampling of parameter space and it can quantify the uncertainty in the predictions of state trajectories. We couple this strategy with structural identifiability and observability analysis, and when these tests detect possible prediction issues we obtain model reparameterizations that surmount them. The end result is an ensemble of models with the ability to predict the internal dynamics of a biological process. We demonstrate our approach with models of glucose regulation, cell division, circadian oscillations, and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway.The code that implements the methodology and reproduces the results is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6782638Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

It was described recently that periportal fibrosis did affect the expression of CYP proteins, a set of pericentrally located drug-metabolizing enzymes. Here, we investigated whether periportal steatosis might have a similar effect. Periportal steatosis was induced in C57BL6/J mice by feeding a high-fat diet with low methionine/choline content for either two or four weeks. Steatosis severity was quantified using image analysis. Triglycerides and CYP activity were quantified in photometric or fluorometric assay. The distribution of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 was visualized by immunohistochemistry. Pharmacokinetic parameters of test drugs were determined after injecting a drug cocktail (caffeine, codeine, and midazolam). The dietary model resulted in moderate to severe mixed steatosis confined to periportal and midzonal areas. Periportal steatosis did not affect the zonal distribution of CYP expression but the activity of selected CYPs was associated with steatosis severity. Caffeine elimination was accelerated by microvesicular steatosis, whereas midazolam elimination was delayed in macrovesicular steatosis. In summary, periportal steatosis affected parameters of pericentrally located drug metabolism. This observation calls for further investigations of the highly complex interrelationship between steatosis and drug metabolism and underlying signaling mechanisms.},

  abstract  = {The neurovascular and neurometabolic couplings (NVC and NMC) connect cerebral activity, blood flow, and metabolism. This interconnection is used in for instance functional imaging, which analyses the blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD) signal. The mechanisms underlying the NVC are complex, which warrants a model-based analysis of data. We have previously developed a mechanistically detailed model for the NVC, and others have proposed detailed models for cerebral metabolism. However, existing metabolic models are still not fully utilizing available magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data and are not connected to detailed models for NVC. Therefore, we herein present a new model that integrates mechanistic modelling of both MRS and BOLD data. The metabolic model covers central metabolism, using a minimal set of interactions, and can describe time-series data for glucose, lactate, aspartate, and glutamate, measured after visual stimuli. Statistical tests confirm that the model can describe both estimation data and predict independent validation data, not used for model training. The interconnected NVC model can simultaneously describe BOLD data and can be used to predict expected metabolic responses in experiments where metabolism has not been measured. This model is a step towards a useful and mechanistically detailed model for cerebral blood flow and metabolism, with potential applications in both basic research and clinical applications.},

The DG-FSA method is used to reduce computational cost required for model-based ion-exchange chromatography development using industrial load samples. As an example, the design of an anion-exchange chromatography step is considered. This step is used to purify an experimental peptide product called Protein G from Novo Nordisk A/S (Bagsvrd, Denmark). The results demonstrate, that a fourth order DG-FSA method can reduce computational cost of inverse problems by a factor ×16 compared to a second (low) order DG-FSA method. Furthermore, the fourth-order DG-FSA method enable the computation of probability distributions of optimized processing conditions given uncertainty in model parameters or inputs. This analysis is not possible within a reasonable timeframe when applying the second (low) order DG-FSA method. The design procedure facilitates the optimization of the Protein G purification step. In an experimental validation run, the productivity is increased by 70% while sacrificing 4% yield at a similar purity constraint compared to an experiment with baseline performance.},

Many parameters of such models are usually unknown and have to be inferred from experimental data. Gradient-based optimization has proven to be effective for parameter estimation. However, computing gradients becomes increasingly costly for larger models, which are required for capturing the complex interactions of multiple biochemical pathways. Adjoint sensitivity analysis has been pivotal for working with such large models, but methods tailored for steady-state data are currently not available. We propose a new adjoint method for computing gradients, which is applicable if the experimental data include steady-state measurements. The method is based on a reformulation of the backward integration problem to a system of linear algebraic equations. The evaluation of the proposed method using real-world problems shows a speedup of total simulation time by a factor of up to 4.4. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a substantial improvement in computation time, in particular for large-scale models, where computational efficiency is critical.},

However, most models are based on officially reported case numbers, which depend on test availability and test strategies. The time dependence of these factors renders interpretation difficult and might even result in estimation biases. Here, we present a computational modelling framework that allows for the integration of reported case numbers with seroprevalence estimates obtained from representative population cohorts. To account for the time dependence of infection and testing rates, we embed flexible splines in an epidemiological model. The parameters of these splines are estimated, along with the other parameters, from the available data using a Bayesian approach. The application of this approach to the official case numbers reported for Munich (Germany) and the seroprevalence reported by the prospective COVID-19 Cohort Munich (KoCo19) provides first estimates for the time dependence of the under-reporting factor. Furthermore, we estimate how the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and of the testing strategy evolves over time. Overall, our results show that the integration of temporally highly resolved and representative data is beneficial for accurate epidemiological analyses.},

In this article, we study mechanisms of adaptive rewiring in BRAFV600E melanoma cells using an energy-based implementation of ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling in combination with proteomic, transcriptomic and imaging data. We develop a method for causal tracing of ODE models and identify two parallel MAPK reaction channels that are differentially sensitive to RAF and MEK inhibitors due to differences in protein oligomerization and drug binding. We describe how these channels, and timescale separation between immediate-early signaling and transcriptional feedback, create a state in which the RAS-regulated MAPK channel can be activated by growth factors under conditions in which the BRAFV600E-driven channel is fully inhibited. Further development of the approaches in this article is expected to yield a unified model of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma.},

The parameters of these models are rarely known a priori and must instead be estimated by calibration using experimental data. Optimization-based calibration of ODE models on is often challenging, even for low-dimensional problems. Multiple hypotheses have been advanced to explain why biochemical model calibration is challenging, including non-identifiability of model parameters, but there are few comprehensive studies that test these hypotheses, likely because tools for performing such studies are also lacking. Nonetheless, reliable model calibration is essential for uncertainty analysis, model comparison, and biological interpretation. We implemented an established trust-region method as a modular Python framework (fides) to enable systematic comparison of different approaches to ODE model calibration involving a variety of Hessian approximation schemes. We evaluated fides on a recently developed corpus of biologically realistic benchmark problems for which real experimental data are available. Unexpectedly, we observed high variability in optimizer performance among different implementations of the same mathematical instructions (algorithms). Analysis of possible sources of poor optimizer performance identified limitations in the widely used Gauss-Newton, BFGS and SR1 Hessian approximation schemes. We addressed these drawbacks with a novel hybrid Hessian approximation scheme that enhances optimizer performance and outperforms existing hybrid approaches. When applied to the corpus of test models, we found that fides was on average more reliable and efficient than existing methods using a variety of criteria. We expect fides to be broadly useful for ODE constrained optimization problems in biochemical models and to be a foundation for future methods development.},

We then investigated whether a putative crosstalk mechanism could be consistent with experimental observations from the LINCS MCF10A Data Cube that IFNγ acts as an anti-proliferative factor. The analyses suggested this observation can be explained by IFNγ-induced SOCS1 sequestering activated EGF receptors.

While splines can be encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) using piecewise functions, the resulting formulas are very complex and difficult to derive by hand. Tools to create such formulas exist but only deal with numeric data and thus cannot be used for function estimation. Similarly, simulation tools suffer from several limitations when handling splines. For example, in the AMICI library splines with large numbers of nodes lead to long model import times. We have developed a set of SBML annotations to mark assignment rules as spline formulas. These compact representations are human-readable and easy to edit, in contrast to the piecewise representation. Different boundary conditions and extrapolation methods can also be specified. By extending AMICI to create and recognize these annotations, model import can be sped up significantly. This allows practitioners to increase the expressivity of their models. While the performance improvement is limited to AMICI, our tools for creating spline formulas can be used for other tools as well and our syntax for compact spline representation may be a starting point for an SBML-native way to represent spline interpolants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) describes the age-related acquisition of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) leading to clonal blood cell expansion. Although CHIP mutations drive myeloid malignancies like myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) it is unknown if clonal expansion is attributable to changes in cell type kinetics, or involves reorganization of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Using computational modeling we analyzed differentiation and proliferation kinetics of cultured hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from 8 healthy individuals, 7 CHIP, and 10 MDS patients. While the standard hematopoietic hierarchy explained HSPC kinetics in healthy samples, 57% of CHIP and 70% of MDS samples were best described with alternative hierarchies. Deregulated kinetics were found at various HSPC compartments with high inter-individual heterogeneity in CHIP and MDS, while altered HSC rates were most relevant in MDS. Quantifying kinetic heterogeneity in detail, we show that reorganization of the HSPC compartment is detectable in the premalignant CHIP state.},

  abstract         = {Abstract Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases mediated by whole-body changes to metabolism, cardiovascular structure and haemodynamics. The haemodynamic changes related to hypertension and T2D are complex and subject-specific, however, and not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the haemodynamic mechanisms in T2D and hypertension by comparing the haemodynamics between healthy controls and subjects with T2D, hypertension, or both. For all subjects, we combined 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging data, brachial blood pressure and a cardiovascular mathematical model to create a comprehensive subject-specific analysis of central haemodynamics. When comparing the subject-specific haemodynamic parameters between the four groups, the predominant haemodynamic difference is impaired left ventricular relaxation in subjects with both T2D and hypertension compared to subjects with only T2D, only hypertension and controls. The impaired relaxation indicates that, in this cohort, the long-term changes in haemodynamic load of co-existing T2D and hypertension cause diastolic dysfunction demonstrable at rest, whereas either disease on its own does not. However, through subject-specific predictions of impaired relaxation, we show that altered relaxation alone is not enough to explain the subject-specific and group-related differences; instead, a combination of parameters is affected in T2D and hypertension. These results confirm previous studies that reported more adverse effects from the combination of T2D and hypertension compared to either disease on its own. Furthermore, this shows the potential of personalized cardiovascular models in providing haemodynamic mechanistic insights and subject-specific predictions that could aid in the understanding and treatment planning of patients with T2D and hypertension. Key points The combination of 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging data and a cardiovascular mathematical model allows for a comprehensive analysis of subject-specific haemodynamic parameters that otherwise cannot be derived non-invasively. Using this combination, we show that diastolic dysfunction in subjects with both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension is the main group-level difference between controls, subjects with T2D, subjects with hypertension, and subjects with both T2D and hypertension. These results suggest that, in this relatively healthy population, the additional load of both hypertension and T2D affects the haemodynamic function of the left ventricle, whereas each disease on its own is not enough to cause significant effects under resting conditions. Finally, using the subject-specific model, we show that the haemodynamic effects of diastolic dysfunction alone are not sufficient to explain all the observed haemodynamic differences. Instead, additional subject-specific variations in cardiac and vascular function combine to explain the complex haemodynamics of subjects affected by hypertension and/or T2D.},

  abstract         = {The mammalian cell cycle is regulated by a well-studied but complex biochemical reaction system. Computational models provide a particularly systematic and systemic description of the mechanisms governing mammalian cell cycle control. By combining both state-of-the-art multiplexed experimental methods and powerful computational tools, this work aims at improving on these models along four dimensions: model structure, validation data, validation methodology and model reusability. We developed a comprehensive model structure of the full cell cycle that qualitatively explains the behaviour of human retinal pigment epithelial-1 cells. To estimate the model parameters, time courses of eight cell cycle regulators in two compartments were reconstructed from single cell snapshot measurements. After optimisation with a parallel global optimisation metaheuristic we obtained excellent agreements between simulations and measurements. The PEtab specification of the optimisation problem facilitates reuse of model, data and/or optimisation results. Future perturbation experiments will improve parameter identifiability and allow for testing model predictive power. Such a predictive model may aid in drug discovery for cell cycle-related disorders.},
