	Abstract = {Motivation: Mathematical models have become standard tools for the investigation of cellular processes and the unraveling of signal processing mechanisms. The parameters of these models are usually derived from the available data using optimization and sampling methods. However, the efficiency of these methods is limited by the properties of the mathematical model, e.g. non-identifiabilities, and the resulting posterior distribution. In particular, multi-modal distributions with long valleys or pronounced tails are difficult to optimize and sample. Thus, the developement or improvement of optimization and sampling methods is subject to ongoing research.
Results: We suggest a region-based adaptive parallel tempering algorithm which adapts to the problem-specific posterior distributions, i.e. modes and valleys. The algorithm combines several established algorithms to overcome their individual shortcomings and to improve sampling efficiency. We assessed its properties for established benchmark problems and two ordinary differential equation models of biochemical reaction networks. The proposed algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art methods in terms of calculation efficiency and mixing. Since the algorithm does not rely on a specific problem structure, but adapts to the posterior distribution, it is suitable for a variety of model classes.
Availability and implementation: The code is available both as Supplementary Material and in a Git repository written in MATLAB.
Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract      = {Cellular development has traditionally been described as a series of transitions between discrete cell states, such as the sequence of double negative, double positive and single positive stages in T-cell development. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics suggest an alternative description of development, in which cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories. A cell{\textquoteright}s state along such a trajectory can be captured with pseudotemporal ordering, which however is not able to predict development of the system in real time. We present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that integrates time-series and genetic knock-out information with such transcriptome-based descriptions in order to describe and analyze the real-time evolution of the system. Pseudodynamics models the distribution of a cell population across a continuous cell state coordinate over time based on a stochastic differential equation along developmental trajectories and random switching between trajectories in branching regions. To illustrate feasibility, we use pseudodynamics to estimate cell-state-dependent growth and differentiation of thymic T-cell development. The model approximates a developmental potential function (Waddington{\textquoteright}s landscape) and suggests that thymic T-cell development is biphasic and not strictly deterministic before beta-selection. Pseudodynamics generalizes classical discrete population models to continuous states and thus opens possibilities such as probabilistic model selection to single cell genomics.},

	Abstract = {Single-cell time-lapse studies have advanced the quantitative understanding of cellular pathways and their inherent cell-to-cell variability. However, parameters retrieved from individual experiments are model dependent and their estimation is limited, if based on solely one kind of experiment. Hence, methods to integrate data collected under different conditions are expected to improve model validation and information content. Here we present a multi-experiment nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach for mechanistic pathway models, which allows the integration of multiple single-cell perturbation experiments. We apply this approach to the translation of green fluorescent protein after transfection using a massively parallel read-out of micropatterned single-cell arrays. We demonstrate that the integration of data from perturbation experiments allows the robust reconstruction of cell-to-cell variability, i.e., parameter densities, while each individual experiment provides insufficient information. Indeed, we show that the integration of the datasets on the population level also improves the estimates for individual cells by breaking symmetries, although each of them is only measured in one experiment. Moreover, we confirmed that the suggested approach is robust with respect to batch effects across experimental replicates and can provide mechanistic insights into the nature of batch effects. We anticipate that the proposed multi-experiment nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach will serve as a basis for the analysis of cellular heterogeneity in single-cell dynamics.},

@article{LoosKra2018,
	Abstract = {Mathematical models are nowadays important tools for analyzing dynamics of cellular processes. The unknown model parameters are usually estimated from experimental data. These data often only provide information about the relative changes between conditions, hence, the observables contain scaling parameters. The unknown scaling parameters and corresponding noise parameters have to be inferred along with the dynamic parameters. The nuisance parameters often increase the dimensionality of the estimation problem substantially and cause convergence problems. In this manuscript, we propose a hierarchical optimization approach for estimating the parameters for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models from relative data. Our approach restructures the optimization problem into an inner and outer subproblem. These subproblems possess lower dimensions than the original optimization problem, and the inner problem can be solved analytically. We evaluated accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency of the hierarchical approach by studying three signaling pathways. The proposed approach achieved better convergence than the standard approach and required a lower computation time. As the hierarchical optimization approach is widely applicable, it provides a powerful alternative to established approaches.},

  abstract     = {Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has recently been identified as the primary protein that detects cytosolic double stranded DNA to invoke a type I interferon response. The cGAS pathway is vital in the recognition of DNA encoded viruses as well as self-DNA leaked from the nucleus of damaged cells. Currently, the dynamics regulating the cGAS pathway are poorly understood; limiting our knowledge of how DNA-induced immune responses are regulated. Using systems biology approaches, we formulated a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of this pathway and examine the resulting system-level emergent properties. Unknown model parameters were fit to data compiled from literature using a Parallel Tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PT-MCMC) approach, resulting in an ensemble of parameterized models. A local sensitivity analysis demonstrated that parameter sensitivity trends across model ensembles were independent of the select parameterization. An in-silico knock-down of TREX1 found that the interferon response is highly robust, showing that complete inhibition is necessary to induce chemical conditions consistent with chronic inflammation. Lastly, we demonstrate that the model recapitulates interferon expression data resulting from small molecule inhibition of cGAS. Overall, the importance of this model is exhibited in its capacity to identify sensitive components of the cGAS pathway, generate testable hypotheses, and confirm experimental observations.},

  abstract        = {Dynamic modelling is a core element in the systems biology approach to understanding complex biosystems. Here, we consider the problem of parameter estimation in models of biological oscillators described by deterministic nonlinear differential equations. These problems can be extremely challenging due to several common pitfalls: (i) a lack of prior knowledge about parameters (i.e. massive search spaces), (ii) convergence to local optima (due to multimodality of the cost function), (iii) overfitting (fitting the noise instead of the signal) and (iv) a lack of identifiability. As a consequence, the use of standard estimation methods (such as gradient-based local ones) will often result in wrong solutions. Overfitting can be particularly problematic, since it produces very good calibrations, giving the impression of an excellent result. However, overfitted models exhibit poor predictive power. Here, we present a novel automated approach to overcome these pitfalls. Its workflow makes use of two sequential optimisation steps incorporating three key algorithms: (1) sampling strategies to systematically tighten the parameter bounds reducing the search space, (2) efficient global optimisation to avoid convergence to local solutions, (3) an advanced regularisation technique to fight overfitting. In addition, this workflow incorporates tests for structural and practical identifiability. We successfully evaluate this novel approach considering four difficult case studies regarding the calibration of well-known biological oscillators (Goodwin, FitzHugh-Nagumo, Repressilator and a metabolic oscillator). In contrast, we show how local gradient-based approaches, even if used in multi-start fashion, are unable to avoid the above-mentioned pitfalls. Our approach results in more efficient estimations (thanks to the bounding strategy) which are able to escape convergence to local optima (thanks to the global optimisation approach). Further, the use of regularisation allows us to avoid overfitting, resulting in more generalisable calibrated models (i.e. models with greater predictive power).},

However, some biological processes require the consideration of comprehensive reaction networks and therefore large-scale models. Parameter estimation for such models poses great challenges, in particular when the data are on a relative scale.Here, we propose a novel hierarchical approach combining (i) the efficient analytic evaluation of optimal scaling, offset, and error model parameters with (ii) the scalable evaluation of objective function gradients using adjoint sensitivity analysis. We evaluate the properties of the methods by parameterizing a pan-cancer ordinary differential equation model (\\&gt;1000 state variables, \\&gt;4000 parameters) using relative protein, phospho-protein and viability measurements. The hierarchical formulation improves optimizer performance considerably. Furthermore, we show that this approach allows estimating error model parameters with negligible computational overhead when no experimental estimates are available, providing an unbiased way to weight heterogeneous data. Overall, our hierarchical formulation is applicable to a wide range of models, and allows for the efficient parameterization of large-scale models based on heterogeneous relative measurements.Supplementary information are available at Bioinformatics online.

As model sizes and datasets are steadily growing, established parameter optimization approaches for mechanistic models become computationally extremely challenging. However, mini-batch optimization methods, as employed in deep learning, have better scaling properties. In this work, we adapt, apply, and benchmark mini-batch optimization for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models thereby establishing a direct link between dynamic modeling and machine learning. On our main application example, a large-scale model of cancer signaling, we benchmark mini-batch optimization against established methods, achieving better optimization results and reducing computation by more than an order of magnitude. We expect that our work will serve as a first step towards mini-batch optimization tailored to ODE models and enable modeling of even larger and more complex systems than what is currently possible.},

We take a quantitative computational modeling approach to describe propagation of histone H3K27 and H3K36 methylation states. We measure combinatorial H3K27 and H3K36 methylation patterns by quantitative mass spectrometry on subsequent generations of histones. Using model comparison, we reject active global demethylation and invoke the existence of domains defined by distinct methylation endpoints. We find that H3K27me3 on pre-existing histones stimulates the rate of de novo H3K27me3 establishment, supporting a read-write mechanism in timely chromatin restoration. Finally, we provide a detailed quantitative picture of the mutual antagonism between H3K27 and H3K36 methylation and propose that it stabilizes epigenetic states across cell division.},

However, for qualitative data the available approaches are limited and computationally demanding. Here, we consider the optimal scaling method which has been developed in statistics for categorical data and has been applied to dynamical systems. This approach turns qualitative variables into quantitative ones, accounting for constraints on their relation. We derive a reduced formulation for the optimization problem defining the optimal scaling. The reduced formulation possesses the same optimal points as the established formulation but requires less degrees of freedom. Parameter estimation for dynamical models of cellular pathways revealed that the reduced formulation improves the robustness and convergence of optimizers. This resulted in substantially reduced computation times. We implemented the proposed approach in the open-source Python Parameter EStimation TOolbox (pyPESTO) to facilitate reuse and extension.

  abstract = {In systems and computational biology, ordinary differential equations are used for the mechanistic modelling of biochemical networks. These models can easily have hundreds of states and parameters. Typically most parameters are unknown and estimated by fitting model output to observation. During parameter estimation the model needs to be solved repeatedly, sometimes millions of times. This can then be a computational bottleneck, and limits the employment of such models. In many situations the experimental data provides information about the steady state of the biochemical reaction network. In such cases one only needs to obtain the equilibrium state for a given set of model parameters. In this paper we exploit this fact and solve the steady state problem directly rather than integrating the ODE forward in time until steady state is reached. We use Newton’s method - like some previous studies - and develop several improvements to achieve robust convergence. To address the reliance of Newtons method on good initial guesses, we propose a continuation method. We show that the method works robustly in this setting and achieves a speed up of up to 100 compared to using ODE solves.},

  abstract = {{Kinetic models contain unknown parameters that are estimated by optimizing the fit to experimental data. This task can be computationally challenging due to the presence of local optima and ill-conditioning. While a variety of optimization methods have been suggested to surmount these issues, it is difficult to choose the best one for a given problem a priori. A systematic comparison of parameter estimation methods for problems with tens to hundreds of optimization variables is currently missing, and smaller studies provided contradictory findings.We use a collection of benchmarks to evaluate the performance of two families of optimization methods: (i) multi-starts of deterministic local searches and (ii) stochastic global optimization metaheuristics; the latter may be combined with deterministic local searches, leading to hybrid methods. A fair comparison is ensured through a collaborative evaluation and a consideration of multiple performance metrics. We discuss possible evaluation criteria to assess the trade-off between computational efficiency and robustness. Our results show that, thanks to recent advances in the calculation of parametric sensitivities, a multi-start of gradient-based local methods is often a successful strategy, but a better performance can be obtained with a hybrid metaheuristic. The best performer combines a global scatter search metaheuristic with an interior point local method, provided with gradients estimated with adjoint-based sensitivities. We provide an implementation of this method to render it available to the scientific community.The code to reproduce the results is provided as Supplementary Material and is available at Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1304034.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

  abstract = {Mixed effect modeling is widely used to study cell-to-cell and patient-to-patient variability. The population statistics of mixed effect models is usually approximated using Dirac mixture distributions obtained using Monte-Carlo, quasi Monte-Carlo, and sigma point methods. Here, we propose the use of a method based on the Cramér-von Mises Distance, which has been introduced in the context of filtering. We assess the accuracy of the different methods using several problems and provide the first scalability study for the Cramér-von Mises Distance method. Our results indicate that for a given number of points, the method based on the modified Cramér-von Mises Distance method tends to achieve a better approximation accuracy than Monte-Carlo and quasi Monte-Carlo methods. In contrast to sigma-point methods, the method based on the modified Cramér-von Mises Distance allows for a flexible number of points and a more accurate approximation for nonlinear problems.},

  abstract     = {Epidemiological models are widely used to analyse the spread of diseases such as the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, all models are based on simplifying assumptions and on sparse data. This limits the reliability of parameter estimates and predictions. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the relevance of these limitations by performing a study of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. We perform parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis and model selection for a range of established epidemiological models. Amongst others, we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, parameter and prediction profile calculation algorithms. Our results show that parameter estimates and predictions obtained for several established models on the basis of reported case numbers can be subject to substantial uncertainty. More importantly, estimates were often unrealistic and the confidence / credibility intervals did not cover plausible values of critical parameters obtained using different approaches. These findings suggest, amongst others, that several models are over-simplistic and that the reported case numbers provide often insufficient information.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the European Union{\textquoteright}s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (CanPathPro; Grant no. 686282; E.D., J.H., S.M.), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (Grant no. 031L0159C; E.A. \&amp; Grant no. 01ZX1705; J.H.), the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (Grant no. 16KN074236; J.V.), and the German Research Foundation (Clusters of Excellence EXC 2047 \&amp; EXC 2151; E.R., F.B., J.H.).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

  abstract  = {Summary
Targeted inhibition of oncogenic pathways can be highly effective in halting the rapid growth of tumors but often leads to the emergence of slowly dividing persister cells, which constitute a reservoir for the selection of drug-resistant clones. In BRAFV600E melanomas, RAF and MEK inhibitors efficiently block oncogenic signaling, but persister cells emerge. Here, we show that persister cells escape drug-induced cell-cycle arrest via brief, sporadic ERK pulses generated by transmembrane receptors and growth factors operating in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Quantitative proteomics and computational modeling show that ERK pulsing is enabled by rewiring of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling: from an oncogenic BRAFV600E monomer-driven configuration that is drug sensitive to a receptor-driven configuration that involves Ras-GTP and RAF dimers and is highly resistant to RAF and MEK inhibitors. Altogether, this work shows that pulsatile MAPK activation by factors in the microenvironment generates a persistent population of melanoma cells that rewires MAPK signaling to sustain non-genetic drug resistance.},

This connection is the basis for the interpretation of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Despite the central role of this coupling, we lack detailed knowledge about cell-specific contributions and our knowledge about NVC is mainly based on animal experiments performed during anesthesia. Anesthetics are known to affect neuronal excitability, but how this affects the vessel diameters is not known. Due to the high complexity of NVC data, mathematical modeling is needed for a meaningful analysis. However, neither the relevant neuronal subtypes nor the effects of anesthetics are covered by current models. Here, we present a mathematical model including GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal neurons, as well as the effect of an anesthetic agent. The model is consistent with data from optogenetic experiments from both awake and anesthetized animals, and it correctly predicts data from experiments with different pharmacological modulators. The analysis suggests that no downstream anesthetic effects are necessary if one of the GABAergic interneuron signaling pathways include a Michaelis-Menten expression. This is the first example of a quantitative model that includes both the cell-specific contributions and the effect of an anesthetic agent on the NVC.},

  year        = {2020},
  abstract    = {The brain is critically dependent on the continuous supply of oxygen and glucose, which is carried and delivered by blood. When a brain region is activated, metabolism of these substrates increases rapidly, but is quickly offset by a substantially higher increase in blood ﬂow to that region, resulting in a brief oversupply of these substrates. This phenomenon is referred to as functional hyperemia, and forms the foundation of functional neuroimaging techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which captures a Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal. fMRI exploits these BOLD signals to infer brain activity, an approach that has revolutionized the research of brain function over the last 30 years. Due to the indirect nature of this measure, a deeper understanding of the connection between brain activity and hemodynamic changes — a neurovascular coupling (NVC) — is essential in order to fully interpret such functional imaging data. NVC connects the synaptic activity of neurons with local changes in cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and cerebral metabolism of oxygen, through a complex signaling network, consisting of multiple different brain cells which release a myriad of distinct vasoactive messengers with specific vascular targets. To aid with this complexity, mathematical modeling can provide vital help using methods and tools from the field of Systems Biology. Previous models of the NVC exist, conventionally describing quasi-phenomenological steps translating neuronal activity into hemodynamic changes. However, no mechanistic mathematical model that describe the known intracellular mechanisms or hypotheses underlying the NVC, and which can account for a wide variety of NVC related measurements, currently exists. Therefore, in this thesis, we apply a Systems Biology approach to develop such intracellular mechanisms based models using in vivo experimental data consisting of different NVC related measures in rodents, primates, and humans. Paper I investigates two widely discussed hypotheses describing the NVC: the metabolic feedback hypothesis, and the vasoactive feed-forward hypothesis. We illustrate through multiple model rejections that only a model describing a combination of the two hypotheses can capture the qualitative features of the BOLD signal, as measured in humans. This combined model can describe data used for training, as well as predict independent validation data not previously seen by the model before. Paper II extends this model to describe the negative BOLD response, where the blood oxygenation drops below basal levels, which is commonly observed in clinical and cognitive studies. The model explains the negative BOLD response as the result of neuronal inhibition, describing and adequately predicting experimental data from two different experiments. In Paper III, we develop a first model including the cell-specific contributions of GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal neurons to functional hyperemia, using data of optogenetic and sensory stimuli in rodents for both awake and anesthesia conditions. The model captures the effect of the anesthetic as purely acting on the neuronal level if a Michaelis-Menten expression is included, and it also correctly predicts data from experiments with different pharmacological inhibitors. Finally, in Paper IV, we extend the model in Paper III to describe and predict a majority of the relevant hemodynamic NVC measures using data from rodents, primates, and humans. The model suggests an explanation for observed bi-modal behaviors, and can be used to generate new insights regarding the underpinnings of other complicated observed behaviors. This model constitutes the most complete mechanistic model of the NVC to date. This new model-based understanding opens the door for a more integrative approach to the analysis of neuroimaging data, with potential applications in both basic science and in the clinic.},

  abstract  = {Data integration to model-based description of biological systems incorporating gene dynamics improves the performance of microbial systems. Bioprocess performance, typically predicted using empirical Monod-type models, is essential for a sustainable bioeconomy. To replace empirical models, we updated a hybrid gene regulatory network-growth kinetic model, predicting aromatic pollutants degradation and biomass growth in Pseudomonas putida mt-2. We modeled a complex biological system including extensive information to understand the role of the regulatory elements in toluene biodegradation and biomass growth. The updated model exhibited extra complications such as the existence of oscillations and discontinuities. As parameter estimation of complex biological models remains a key challenge, we used the updated model to present a dual-parameter identification approach (the ‘dual approach’) combining two independent methodologies. Approach I handled the complexity by incorporation of demonstrated biological knowledge in the model-development process and combination of global sensitivity analysis and optimisation. Approach II complemented Approach I handling multimodality, ill-conditioning and overfitting through regularisation estimation, global optimisation, and identifiability analysis. To systematically quantify the biological system, we used a vast amount of high-quality time-course data. The dual approach resulted in an accurately calibrated kinetic model (NRMSE: 0.17055) efficiently handling the additional model complexity. We tested model validation using three independent experimental data sets, achieving greater predictive power (NRMSE: 0.18776) than the individual approaches (NRMSE I: 0.25322, II: 0.25227) and increasing model robustness. These results demonstrated data-driven predictive modeling potentially leading to bioprocess’ model-based control and optimisation.},

However, measuring changes in cell cycle progression is experimentally challenging, and model inference computationally expensive.Results Here, we introduce a computational framework that allows the inference of changes in cell cycle progression from static single-cell measurements. We modeled population dynamics with partial differential equations (PDE), and derive parameter gradients to estimate time- and cell cycle position-dependent progression changes efficiently. Additionally, we show that computing parameter sensitivities for the optimization problem by solving a system of PDEs is computationally feasible and allows efficient and exact estimation of parameters. We showcase our framework by estimating the changes in cell cycle progression in K562 cells treated with Nocodazole and identify an arrest in M-phase transition that matches the expected behavior of microtubule polymerization inhibition.Conclusions Our results have two major implications: First, this framework can be scaled to high-throughput compound screens, providing a fast, stable, and efficient protocol to generate new insights into changes in cell cycle progression. Second, knowledge of the cell cycle stage- and time-dependent progression function allows transformation from pseudotime to real-time thereby enabling real-time analysis of molecular rates in response to treatments.Availability MAPiT toolbox (Karsten Kuritz 2020) is available at github: https://github.com/karstenkuritz/MAPiT.},

  abstract     = {The design of efficient combination therapies is a difficult key challenge in the treatment of complex diseases such as cancers. The large heterogeneity of cancers and the large number of available drugs renders exhaustive in vivo or even in vitro investigation of possible treatments impractical. In recent years, sophisti-cated mechanistic, ordinary differential equation-based pathways models that can predict treatment responses at a molecular level have been developed. However, surprisingly little effort has been put into leveraging these models to find novel therapies. In this paper we use for the first time, to our knowledge, a large-scale state-of-the-art pan-cancer signaling pathway model to identify potentially novel combination therapies to treat individual cancer cell lines from various tissues (e.g., minimizing proliferation while keeping dosage low to avoid adverse side effects) and populations of cancer cell lines (e.g., minimizing the maximum or average proliferation across the cell lines while keeping dosage low). We also show how our method can be used to optimize the mixtures and dosages used in sequential treatment plans{\textemdash}that is, optimized sequences of potentially different drug combinations{\textemdash}providing additional benefits. In order to solve the treatment optimization problems, we combine the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm with a significantly more scalable sampling scheme for truncated Gaussian distributions, based on a Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo method. These optimization techniques are independent of the signaling pathway model, and can thus be used for other signaling pathway models also, provided that a suitable predictive model is available.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Rapid cell divisions and DNA replication however lead to a dilution of histone modifications and can thus affect chromatin mediated gene regulation So how does the cell-cycle shape the histone modification landscape, in particular during embryogenesis when a fast and precise control of cell-specific gene expression is required?We addressed this question in vivo by manipulating the cell-cycle during early Xenopus laevis embryogenesis. The global distribution of un-, mono- di- and tri-methylated histone H4K20 was measured by mass spectrometry in normal and cell-cycle arrested embryos over time. Using multi-start maximum likelihood optimization and quantitative model selection, we found that three specific methylation rate constants were required to explain the measured H4K20 methylation state kinetics. Interestingly, demethylation was found to be redundant in the cycling embryos but essential in the cell-cycle arrested embryos.Together, we present the first quantitative analysis of in vivo histone H4K20 methylation kinetics. Our computational model shows that demethylation is only essential for regulating H4K20 methylation kinetics in non-cycling cells. In rapidly dividing cells of early embryos, we predict that demethylation is dispensable, suggesting that cell-cycle mediated dilution of chromatin marks is an essential regulatory component for shaping the epigenetic landscape during early embryonic development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract     = {Motivation Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is an increasingly popular method for likelihood-free parameter inference in systems biology and other fields of research, since it allows analysing complex stochastic models. However, the introduced approximation error is often not clear. It has been shown that ABC actually gives exact inference under the implicit assumption of a measurement noise model. Noise being common in biological systems, it is intriguing to exploit this insight. But this is difficult in practice, since ABC is in general highly computationally demanding. Thus, the question we want to answer here is how to efficiently account for measurement noise in ABC.Results We illustrate exemplarily how ABC yields erroneous parameter estimates when neglecting measurement noise. Then, we discuss practical ways of correctly including the measurement noise in the analysis. We present an efficient adaptive sequential importance sampling based algorithm applicable to various model types and noise models. We test and compare it on several models, including ordinary and stochastic differential equations, Markov jump processes, and stochastically interacting agents, and noise models including normal, Laplace, and Poisson noise. We conclude that the proposed algorithm could improve the accuracy of parameter estimates for a broad spectrum of applications.Availability The developed algorithms are made publicly available as part of the open-source python toolbox pyABC (https://github.com/icb-dcm/pyabc).Contact jan.hasenauer{at}uni-bonn.deSupplementary information Supplementary information is available at bioRxiv online.

To identify components of JAK2/STAT5 signal transduction that contribute to the graded population response, a cell population-level model calibrated with experimental data was extended to study the behavior in single cells. The single-cell model showed that the high cell-to-cell variability in nuclear phosphorylated STAT5 is caused by variability in the amount of EpoR:JAK2 complexes and of SHP1 as well as the extent of nuclear import due to the large variance in the cytoplasmic volume of CFU-E cells. 24 to 118 pSTAT5 molecules in the nucleus for 120 min are sufficient to ensure cell survival.

  abstract  = {Intheﬁeldofpharmacologics,physiologically-basedpharmacokinetic(PBPK)models can be used for predicting the pharmacokinetics of a drug compound in the body. These models are often a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) that describe the transport of a drug between diﬀerent compartments of the body. The models depend on several parameters, some of which cannot be measured experimentally and instead these parameters are often estimated from experimental data using maximum likelihood. However, in many applications in systems biology, estimates will suﬀer from unidentiﬁability issues, meaning that well-determined estimates cannot be inferred from the data [17]. Thisproblemcomesintwoforms,structuralunidentiﬁabilityandpracticalunidentiﬁability,bothofwhichcanbeanalyzedwiththeproﬁlelikelihoodmethoddeveloped by Raue et.al [14]. The proﬁle likelihood method is a numerical method for calculating likelihood-based conﬁdence intervals of the parameters, which are then used to assess identiﬁability. In this project the proﬁle likelihood method is implemented in MATLAB and used to perform identiﬁability analysis on key model parameters for three PBPK models using simulated data. Thus, the results of this project are both a showcase of the proﬁlelikelihoodmethodandananalysisoftheidentiﬁabilityofparametersinsome speciﬁc models used for pulmonary drug delivery. The results indicate that if very precise measurements could be taken then all parameters considered would be identiﬁable. When a reasonable measurement error is applied on the simulated data the same is not true. Some parameters, such as the in-vivo pulmonary permeability and deposition fraction will remain identiﬁable, but most other parameters will suﬀer from practical unidentiﬁability. With a reasonable measurement error the identiﬁability of most model parameters will also be dependent on the particular error realization. To address these issues, additional dataisconsideredbyobservinghowtheuncertaintyinparameterestimatesimpacts observables. Bythismethod(alsosuggestedbyRaue[14])additionalmeasurements are introduced in an eﬀective manner to potentially resolve unidentiﬁabilities.

  abstract     = {The current era of big biomedical data accumulation and availability brings data integration opportunities for leveraging its totality to make new discoveries and/or clinically predictive models. Black-box statistical and machine learning methods are powerful for such integration, but often cannot provide mechanistic reasoning, particularly on the single-cell level. While single-cell mechanistic models clearly enable such reasoning, they are predominantly {\textquotedblleft}small-scale{\textquotedblright}, and struggle with the scalability and reusability required for meaningful data integration. Here, we present an open-source pipeline for scalable, single-cell mechanistic modeling from simple, annotated input files that can serve as a foundation for mechanistic data integration. As a test case, we convert one of the largest existing single-cell mechanistic models to this format, demonstrating robustness and reproducibility of the approach. We show that the model cell line context can be changed with simple replacement of input file parameter values. We next use this new model to test alternative mechanistic hypotheses for the experimental observations that interferon-gamma (IFNG) inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell proliferation. Model- based analysis suggested, and experiments support that these observations are better explained by IFNG-induced SOCS1 expression sequestering activated EGF receptors, thereby downregulating AKT activity, as opposed to direct IFNG-induced upregulation of p21 expression. Overall, this new pipeline enables large-scale, single-cell, and mechanistically-transparent modeling as a data integration modality complementary to machine learning.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract  = {Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are a key tool to understand complex mechanisms in systems biology. These models are studied using various approaches, including stability and bifurcation analysis, but most frequently by numerical simulations. The number of required simulations is often large, e.g., when unknown parameters need to be inferred. This renders efficient and reliable numerical integration methods essential. However, these methods depend on various hyperparameters, which strongly impact the ODE solution. Despite this, and although hundreds of published ODE models are freely available in public databases, a thorough study that quantifies the impact of hyperparameters on the ODE solver in terms of accuracy and computation time is still missing. In this manuscript, we investigate which choices of algorithms and hyperparameters are generally favorable when dealing with ODE models arising from biological processes. To ensure a representative evaluation, we considered 142 published models. Our study provides evidence that most ODEs in computational biology are stiff, and we give guidelines for the choice of algorithms and hyperparameters. We anticipate that our results will help researchers in systems biology to choose appropriate numerical methods when dealing with ODE models.},

  title        = {Efficient gradient-based parameter estimation for dynamic models using qualitative data},
  year         = {2021},
  abstract     = {Motivation Unknown parameters of dynamical models are commonly estimated from experimental data. However, while various efficient optimization and uncertainty analysis methods have been proposed for quantitative data, methods for qualitative data are rare and suffer from bad scaling and convergence.Results Here, we propose an efficient and reliable framework for estimating the parameters of ordinary differential equation models from qualitative data. In this framework, we derive a semi-analytical algorithm for gradient calculation of the optimal scaling method developed for qualitative data. This enables the use of efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that the use of gradient information improves performance of optimization and uncertainty quantification on several application examples. On average, we achieve a speedup of more than one order of magnitude compared to gradient-free optimization. Additionally, in some examples, the gradient-based approach yields substantially improved objective function values and quality of the fits. Accordingly, the proposed framework substantially improves the parameterization of models from qualitative data.Availability The proposed approach is implemented in the open-source Python Parameter EStimation TOolbox (pyPESTO).
