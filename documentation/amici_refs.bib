	Abstract = {Motivation: Mathematical models have become standard tools for the investigation of cellular processes and the unraveling of signal processing mechanisms. The parameters of these models are usually derived from the available data using optimization and sampling methods. However, the efficiency of these methods is limited by the properties of the mathematical model, e.g. non-identifiabilities, and the resulting posterior distribution. In particular, multi-modal distributions with long valleys or pronounced tails are difficult to optimize and sample. Thus, the developement or improvement of optimization and sampling methods is subject to ongoing research.
Results: We suggest a region-based adaptive parallel tempering algorithm which adapts to the problem-specific posterior distributions, i.e. modes and valleys. The algorithm combines several established algorithms to overcome their individual shortcomings and to improve sampling efficiency. We assessed its properties for established benchmark problems and two ordinary differential equation models of biochemical reaction networks. The proposed algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art methods in terms of calculation efficiency and mixing. Since the algorithm does not rely on a specific problem structure, but adapts to the posterior distribution, it is suitable for a variety of model classes.
Availability and implementation: The code is available both as Supplementary Material and in a Git repository written in MATLAB.
Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract      = {Cellular development has traditionally been described as a series of transitions between discrete cell states, such as the sequence of double negative, double positive and single positive stages in T-cell development. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics suggest an alternative description of development, in which cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories. A cell{\textquoteright}s state along such a trajectory can be captured with pseudotemporal ordering, which however is not able to predict development of the system in real time. We present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that integrates time-series and genetic knock-out information with such transcriptome-based descriptions in order to describe and analyze the real-time evolution of the system. Pseudodynamics models the distribution of a cell population across a continuous cell state coordinate over time based on a stochastic differential equation along developmental trajectories and random switching between trajectories in branching regions. To illustrate feasibility, we use pseudodynamics to estimate cell-state-dependent growth and differentiation of thymic T-cell development. The model approximates a developmental potential function (Waddington{\textquoteright}s landscape) and suggests that thymic T-cell development is biphasic and not strictly deterministic before beta-selection. Pseudodynamics generalizes classical discrete population models to continuous states and thus opens possibilities such as probabilistic model selection to single cell genomics.},

	Abstract = {Single-cell time-lapse studies have advanced the quantitative understanding of cellular pathways and their inherent cell-to-cell variability. However, parameters retrieved from individual experiments are model dependent and their estimation is limited, if based on solely one kind of experiment. Hence, methods to integrate data collected under different conditions are expected to improve model validation and information content. Here we present a multi-experiment nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach for mechanistic pathway models, which allows the integration of multiple single-cell perturbation experiments. We apply this approach to the translation of green fluorescent protein after transfection using a massively parallel read-out of micropatterned single-cell arrays. We demonstrate that the integration of data from perturbation experiments allows the robust reconstruction of cell-to-cell variability, i.e., parameter densities, while each individual experiment provides insufficient information. Indeed, we show that the integration of the datasets on the population level also improves the estimates for individual cells by breaking symmetries, although each of them is only measured in one experiment. Moreover, we confirmed that the suggested approach is robust with respect to batch effects across experimental replicates and can provide mechanistic insights into the nature of batch effects. We anticipate that the proposed multi-experiment nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach will serve as a basis for the analysis of cellular heterogeneity in single-cell dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical models are nowadays important tools for analyzing dynamics of cellular processes. The unknown model parameters are usually estimated from experimental data. These data often only provide information about the relative changes between conditions, hence, the observables contain scaling parameters. The unknown scaling parameters and corresponding noise parameters have to be inferred along with the dynamic parameters. The nuisance parameters often increase the dimensionality of the estimation problem substantially and cause convergence problems. In this manuscript, we propose a hierarchical optimization approach for estimating the parameters for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models from relative data. Our approach restructures the optimization problem into an inner and outer subproblem. These subproblems possess lower dimensions than the original optimization problem, and the inner problem can be solved analytically. We evaluated accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency of the hierarchical approach by studying three signaling pathways. The proposed approach achieved better convergence than the standard approach and required a lower computation time. As the hierarchical optimization approach is widely applicable, it provides a powerful alternative to established approaches.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Mechanistic kinetic models usually contain unknown parameters, which need to be estimated by optimizing the fit of the model to experimental data. This task can be computationally challenging due to the presence of local optima and ill-conditioning. While a variety of optimization methods have been suggested to surmount these issues, it is not obvious how to choose the best one for a given problem a priori, since many factors can influence their performance. A systematic comparison of methods that are suited to parameter estimation problems of sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of optimization variables is currently missing, and smaller studies indeed provided contradictory findings. Results: Here, we use a collection of benchmark problems to evaluate the performance of two families of optimization methods: (i) a multi-start of deterministic local searches; and (ii) a hybrid metaheuristic combining stochastic global search with deterministic local searches. A fair comparison is ensured through a collaborative evaluation, involving researchers applying each method on a daily basis, and a consideration of multiple performance metrics capturing the trade-off between computational efficiency and robustness. Our results show that, thanks to recent advances in the calculation of parametric sensitivities, a multi-start of gradient-based local methods is often a successful strategy, but a better performance can be obtained with a hybrid metaheuristic. The best performer is a combination of a global scatter search metaheuristic with an interior point local method, provided with gradients estimated with adjoint-based sensitivities. We provide an implementation of this novel method in an open-source software toolbox to render it available to the scientific community. Availability and Implementation: The code to reproduce the results is available at Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1160343},

  abstract     = {Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has recently been identified as the primary protein that detects cytosolic double stranded DNA to invoke a type I interferon response. The cGAS pathway is vital in the recognition of DNA encoded viruses as well as self-DNA leaked from the nucleus of damaged cells. Currently, the dynamics regulating the cGAS pathway are poorly understood; limiting our knowledge of how DNA-induced immune responses are regulated. Using systems biology approaches, we formulated a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of this pathway and examine the resulting system-level emergent properties. Unknown model parameters were fit to data compiled from literature using a Parallel Tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PT-MCMC) approach, resulting in an ensemble of parameterized models. A local sensitivity analysis demonstrated that parameter sensitivity trends across model ensembles were independent of the select parameterization. An in-silico knock-down of TREX1 found that the interferon response is highly robust, showing that complete inhibition is necessary to induce chemical conditions consistent with chronic inflammation. Lastly, we demonstrate that the model recapitulates interferon expression data resulting from small molecule inhibition of cGAS. Overall, the importance of this model is exhibited in its capacity to identify sensitive components of the cGAS pathway, generate testable hypotheses, and confirm experimental observations.},

  abstract        = {Dynamic modelling is a core element in the systems biology approach to understanding complex biosystems. Here, we consider the problem of parameter estimation in models of biological oscillators described by deterministic nonlinear differential equations. These problems can be extremely challenging due to several common pitfalls: (i) a lack of prior knowledge about parameters (i.e. massive search spaces), (ii) convergence to local optima (due to multimodality of the cost function), (iii) overfitting (fitting the noise instead of the signal) and (iv) a lack of identifiability. As a consequence, the use of standard estimation methods (such as gradient-based local ones) will often result in wrong solutions. Overfitting can be particularly problematic, since it produces very good calibrations, giving the impression of an excellent result. However, overfitted models exhibit poor predictive power. Here, we present a novel automated approach to overcome these pitfalls. Its workflow makes use of two sequential optimisation steps incorporating three key algorithms: (1) sampling strategies to systematically tighten the parameter bounds reducing the search space, (2) efficient global optimisation to avoid convergence to local solutions, (3) an advanced regularisation technique to fight overfitting. In addition, this workflow incorporates tests for structural and practical identifiability. We successfully evaluate this novel approach considering four difficult case studies regarding the calibration of well-known biological oscillators (Goodwin, FitzHugh-Nagumo, Repressilator and a metabolic oscillator). In contrast, we show how local gradient-based approaches, even if used in multi-start fashion, are unable to avoid the above-mentioned pitfalls. Our approach results in more efficient estimations (thanks to the bounding strategy) which are able to escape convergence to local optima (thanks to the global optimisation approach). Further, the use of regularisation allows us to avoid overfitting, resulting in more generalisable calibrated models (i.e. models with greater predictive power).},

  abstract = {{Mechanistic models of biochemical reaction networks facilitate the quantitative understanding of biological processes and the integration of heterogeneous datasets. However, some biological processes require the consideration of comprehensive reaction networks and therefore large-scale models. Parameter estimation for such models poses great challenges, in particular when the data are on a relative scale.Here, we propose a novel hierarchical approach combining (i) the efficient analytic evaluation of optimal scaling, offset, and error model parameters with (ii) the scalable evaluation of objective function gradients using adjoint sensitivity analysis. We evaluate the properties of the methods by parameterizing a pan-cancer ordinary differential equation model (\\&gt;1000 state variables, \\&gt;4000 parameters) using relative protein, phospho-protein and viability measurements. The hierarchical formulation improves optimizer performance considerably. Furthermore, we show that this approach allows estimating error model parameters with negligible computational overhead when no experimental estimates are available, providing an unbiased way to weight heterogeneous data. Overall, our hierarchical formulation is applicable to a wide range of models, and allows for the efficient parameterization of large-scale models based on heterogeneous relative measurements.Supplementary information are available at Bioinformatics online.

As model sizes and datasets are steadily growing, established parameter optimization approaches for mechanistic models become computationally extremely challenging. However, mini-batch optimization methods, as employed in deep learning, have better scaling properties. In this work, we adapt, apply, and benchmark mini-batch optimization for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models thereby establishing a direct link between dynamic modeling and machine learning. On our main application example, a large-scale model of cancer signaling, we benchmark mini-batch optimization against established methods, achieving better optimization results and reducing computation by more than an order of magnitude. We expect that our work will serve as a first step towards mini-batch optimization tailored to ODE models and enable modeling of even larger and more complex systems than what is currently possible.},

We take a quantitative computational modeling approach to describe propagation of histone H3K27 and H3K36 methylation states. We measure combinatorial H3K27 and H3K36 methylation patterns by quantitative mass spectrometry on subsequent generations of histones. Using model comparison, we reject active global demethylation and invoke the existence of domains defined by distinct methylation endpoints. We find that H3K27me3 on pre-existing histones stimulates the rate of de novo H3K27me3 establishment, supporting a read-write mechanism in timely chromatin restoration. Finally, we provide a detailed quantitative picture of the mutual antagonism between H3K27 and H3K36 methylation and propose that it stabilizes epigenetic states across cell division.},

These models usually comprise unknown parameters, which have to be inferred from experimental data. For quantitative experimental data, there are several methods and software tools available. However, for qualitative data the available approaches are limited and computationally demanding. Here, we consider the optimal scaling method which has been developed in statistics for categorical data and has been applied to dynamical systems. This approach turns qualitative variables into quantitative ones, accounting for constraints on their relation. We derive a reduced formulation for the optimization problem defining the optimal scaling. The reduced formulation possesses the same optimal points as the established formulation but requires less degrees of freedom. Parameter estimation for dynamical models of cellular pathways revealed that the reduced formulation improves the robustness and convergence of optimizers. This resulted in substantially reduced computation times. We implemented the proposed approach in the open-source Python Parameter EStimation TOolbox (pyPESTO) to facilitate reuse and extension.
