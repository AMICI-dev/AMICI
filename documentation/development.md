# AMICI developer's guide

This document contains information for AMICI developers, not too relevant to
regular users.


## Branches / releases

AMICI roughly follows the
[GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). All new
contributions are merged into `develop`. These changes are regularly merged
into `master` as new releases. For release versioning we are trying to follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). New releases are created on Github
and are automatically deployed to
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3362453#.XVwJ9vyxVMA) for archiving and to
obtain a digital object identifier (DOI) to make them citable.
Furthermore, our [CI pipeline](documentation/CI.md) will automatically create
and deploy a new release on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/amici/).

We try to keep a clean git history. Therefore, feature pull requests are
squash-merged to `develop`. Merging of release branches to master is done via
merge commits.   


## When starting to work on some issue

When starting to work on some Github issue, please assign yourself to let other
developers know that you are working on it to avoid duplicate work. If the
respective issue is not completely clear, it is generally a good idea to ask
for clarification before starting to work on it.

If you want to work on something new, please create a Github issue first.


## Code contributions

When making code contributions, please follow our style guide and the process
described below:

* Check if you agree to release your contribution under the conditions provided
  in `LICENSE`. By opening a pull requests you confirm us that you do agree.
  
* Start a new branch from `develop` (on your fork, or at the main
  repository if you have access)

* Implement your changes

* Submit a pull request to the `develop` branch

* Make sure your code is documented appropriately

  * Run `scripts/run-doxygen.sh` to check completeness of your documentation

* Make sure your code is compatible with C++11, `gcc` and `clang`
  (our CI pipeline will do this for you)

* When adding new functionality, please also provide test cases
  (see `tests/cpputest/` and [documentation/CI.md](documentation/CI.md))

* Write meaningful commit messages

* Run all tests to ensure nothing was broken

  * Run `scripts/buildAll.sh && scripts/run-cpputest.sh`.
  
  * If you made changes to the Matlab or C++ code and have a Matlab license,
    please also run `tests/cpputest/wrapTestModels.m` and `tests/testModels.m`

  * If you made changes to the Python or C++ code,
    run `make python-tests` in `build`

* When all tests are passing and you think your code is ready to merge,
  request a code review 
  (see also our [code review guideline](documentation/code_review_guide.md))

* Wait for feedback. If you do not receive feedback to your pull request within
  a week, please give us a friendly reminder.


### Style guide


#### General

* All files and functions should come with file-level and function-level
  documentation.
  
* All new functionality should be covered by unit or integration tests. Runtime
  of those tests should be kept as short as possible. 


#### Python

* We want to be compatible with Python 3.6

* For the Python code we want to follow 
  [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Although this is not the
  case for all existing code, any new contributions should do so. 

* We use Python [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
  for all functions. In Python code type hints should be used instead of
  doxygen `@type`. (All legacy `@type` attributes are to be removed.)
    
  For function docstrings, follow this format:
  
  ```
  """One-line description.
  
  Possible a more detailed description

  Arguments:
      Argument1: This needs to start on the same line, otherwise the current
          doxygen filter will fail.    

      Returns:
          Return value

      Raises:
          SomeError in case of some error.
  """
  ```


#### C++

* We follow C++11

* We want to maintain compatibility with g++, clang and the Intel C++ compiler 

* *Details to be defined*


#### Matlab

*To be defined*
